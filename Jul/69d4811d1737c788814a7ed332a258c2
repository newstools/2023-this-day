Investing in our children is not only a moral imperative but also an investment in the future of society, argues Haleemah Alli The Children’s Day may have come and gone, but its memories continue to linger. I remember that Civil Society Organizations of Nigeria (CSOs) held a befitting Children’s Day webinar to mark the 2023 Children’s Day celebration. Two of the three speakers who spoke at the webinar were Ms. Chiemelie Asogwa, a Basic Six student, and Ms. Mujeebah Opatola, a first-year student at the University of Ibadan. The webinar focused on the imperative of investing in children. It was amazing to see how well all three speakers spoke about investing in children. Mrs. Chinwe Okaro, a mother, lawyer, and child development expert, gave a wonderful presentation. She stated that the school and the family have roles to play in the education of children, but the school should not usurp the role of parents as the primary educators of their children. Instead of usurping the parental role in a child’s upbringing, the school should partner with the parents to ensure that the child receives integral human development. The school has an important role in investing in the development of the pupils in sports and recreational activities. The school should also be concerned about the nutritional value of the students’ food consumption. In addition, the school can ensure that the children are not negatively influenced by peer pressure. Mrs. Okaro also pointed out that the government should invest in school pupils through their parents. For instance, families could have incentives like tax breaks and support in the expenses of child upbringing and education, so they could spend more quality time with the children rather than on making money to cater for the children. The country currently enjoys the Universal Basic Education scheme, while the Child’s Rights Act and government agencies are in place for the protection of Nigerian children. Nigerian society should take a cue from the Western world, where the population is too low to run their society, and that is why they have opened their doors and are welcoming foreigners to come in and fill the vacuum. Nigeria should learn from this and protect and promote the family so that we have a viable population size. She highlighted that the human dignity curriculum used by the Foundation for African Cultural Heritage helps teach children to realize the benefits of what they are asked to do. Our children would naturally have the instinct to say ‘No’, but when it is explained to them and they realize they will benefit from carrying out the instruction, they readily go back on their ‘No’ and perform the given task. She asserted that the true heroes of Children’s Day are the neglected children, some of whom are consequences of insecurity and abduction. She also emphasized that failed leaders are the result of bad or inadequate investment in them during their childhood. Therefore, those who failed to invest positively in the leaders of today are the ones who failed us. It is important to have a society where children are not a threat to us, and this can only be achieved when we are intentional about the investments we make in children. Miss Mujeebah Opatola, an undergraduate, orator, mental health enthusiast, and volunteer, was the second speaker. She emphasized that while school is important, it is not everything. School teachers guide students to have good grades and be knowledgeable, but character development is not the school’s primary focus. It is the duty of parents to personally observe their children, listen to them, and provide them with what they need to thrive emotionally, physically, and socially. She noted that parenting is unique to each child, and a prototype parenting methodology cannot be blindly applied to all children. Parents need to examine each child as if conducting a laboratory experiment, trying to understand and infer from their observations. By doing so, they will be able to nurture the child’s development in a way that is unique to that child. She also emphasized the importance of parents’ investment in the child’s skills, talents, and abilities. She stated that if a child is happy and allowed to thrive in areas that come naturally to them, they will reciprocate by being dutiful to the parents for enabling their happiness in those areas. She discouraged the act of comparison and emphasized that investment should be child-specific, leading them to realize their true selves and full potential, not just focusing on good grades alone. Practical approaches to life can be gained through positive exposure. Chimelie, a Basic six pupil and a World Peace Enthusiast, pointed out that money is absolutely important for parents to cater to the needs of their children. She identified the challenge of expensive school fees and therefore encouraged the government to build more schools where children should be supported, whether they are intelligent or not. There should be provision for all children. The webinar ended on a high note with the participants actively taking part and making contributions, highlighting the fact that children are the leaders of tomorrow and that everyone needs to invest in them. Children are the future leaders of society. By investing in their education, skills, and overall development, we are equipping them to take on leadership roles and contribute positively to their communities and the world at large. Children are the building blocks of human capital. Investing in their health, education, and social well-being enhances their potential to become productive members of society. They will acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to contribute to economic growth and innovation. Investing in children from disadvantaged backgrounds can break the cycle of poverty. Quality education, nutrition, healthcare, and support systems can provide them with the tools to overcome socio-economic barriers and achieve their full potential. Investing in children promotes social stability by fostering equality and reducing disparities. When children have access to quality education and opportunities, regardless of their background, it helps create a more equitable society, reducing social unrest and inequality. Investing in children’s health and well-being ensures a healthier and happier population. Proper nutrition, healthcare, and emotional support contribute to their physical and mental well-being, leading to healthier lifestyles and reduced healthcare costs in the long run. Investing in children fosters creativity, innovation, and progress. By providing them with a quality education that encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, we nurture their potential to become future inventors, scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs. Investing in children’s education and skills development is crucial for maintaining global competitiveness. As the world becomes more interconnected, societies that prioritize education and skill-building for their children will be better equipped to adapt to the changing economic landscape and stay competitive in the global marketplace. Therefore, investing in our children is not only a moral imperative but also an investment in the future of society. By providing them with the necessary resources, support, and opportunities, we empower them to become responsible, productive, and compassionate individuals who can shape a better world for themselves and future generations.Mrs Alli writes from Lagos
