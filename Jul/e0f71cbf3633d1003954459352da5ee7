Flykite Productions, organisers of Naija Super 8, have dismissed reports of harbouring a plan to move the tournament out of Lagos.  There were media reports on  Tuesday that the competition, which is due to start on Friday and end on 16 July, could be moved over a disagreement between the organisers and Lagos State Football Association Vice Chairman,  Alhaji Olawale Gafar, over the latter’s alleged insistence that the association must provide security during the tournament. In a statement issued late on Tuesday,  Flykite Productions said there was no plan to move the competition away from Lagos, adding that it has enjoyed the support of the LSFA, which has given assurance that it will do everything possible to make the competition a success. “We have had support from many football bodies, notably the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the national leagues, the Akwa Ibom State Football Association and, of course, the LSFA. “The LSFA is the host association and it has offered advice on various fronts since it became aware of Naija Super 8. “The LSFA has acted like a partner and stakeholder, which it is, and we have no reason to want to move away from where we have been given support, including vital counselling,” the statement quoted Jenkins Alumona, CEO of Flykite, as saying. Naija Super 8 begins on Friday with an explosive encounter between Enyimba International,  the newly-minted Nigeria Professional Football League champions, and runners-up, Remo Stars of Ikenne at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Lagos.  Organised by Flykite in partnership with MultiChoice, the competition is sponsored by MTN, Hero Lager, DStv, GOtv,  SuperSport, Pepsi, Moniepoint and Custodian Assurance Limited.
