Flykite Productions, organisers of Naija Super 8, have announced their decision to henceforth punish participating clubs, whose chairmen or general managers behave in a disorderly manner during the competition. The decision was announced in a statement issued late on Saturday. According to the organisers, the decision was provoked by a growing trend among administrative heads of clubs to shout tactical instructions at their teams on the pitch during games from the VIP section of the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, venue of the competition. Flykite Productions noted that while football is a game of passion, it expects a better level of restraint from club administrative bosses. “We view as unbecoming the trend of club chairmen or administrative heads yelling instructions at their club players on the pitch during games. “That the clubs have people designated as coaches is proof that the administrative heads sufficiently trust them to dispense the duties assigned to them. “We are not aware of football cultures that accept administrative heads as adjunct coaches.“Even former coaches around the world do not yell instructions when their former teams are playing. “They are restrained, not because they do not have feelings, but because they occupy positions that put them beyond acting like fans. “This, we believe, is the example for our club bosses to follow,” the statement said. It, however, added that club bosses, who run foul of this decision will be inviting the organisers to fine their clubs. “We will be left with no option than to impose financial penalties on clubs, whose bosses shout instructions from the VIP section. “It is a conduct that we consider unbefitting of their status and of the tournament culture we are trying to create,” the organisers stated.
