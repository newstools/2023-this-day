Gideon Arinze in Enugu A non-governmental organisation, the David Folaranmi Foundation, has commended the federal government for its renewed commitment in the fight against drug/substance abuse, especially among young Nigerians. The foundation also said there was the need for improved collaboration among the government, private sector, NGOs, and faith-based organisations to completely rid the country of drug abuse. The Founder of the Foundation, David Folaranmi, made this known yesterday in Enugu during a one-day symposium against drug/substance abuse among youths, with the theme: ‘Addressing the Drug Pandemic Among Our Youths: The Way Out’. In his address, Folaranmi said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) under the leadership of Buba Marwa had invested a lot in tackling the scourge of drug abuse in Nigeria. He said: “However, we cannot leave it for the federal and state governments alone. “There is a need for everybody to join in this noble fight to rescue our youths from the negative consequences of drug/substance abuse.” Earlier, the Executive Director of the Foundation, Nnenna Folaranmi, said the Foundation had done a lot to curb the menace of drug/substance abuse since its inception in 2019. According to her, “We have been able to rehabilitate and revive over 100 drug addicts from the streets and given them a better life and a bright future.” She noted that many of those the Foundation rescued from drug/substance addiction have gone back to school, engaged themselves meaningfully in skills and jobs, and they are doing well in the society. “We have done this through our personal funding and commitment,” she stated, adding that: “Over the years, the Foundation close counseling, follow-up and check on identified addicts have impacted so many young lives in the country.”
