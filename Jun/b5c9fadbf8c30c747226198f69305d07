Dinah Lugard, the founder of The Cure Initiative, has unveiled a groundbreaking documentary titled “Drug Pandemic,” which aims to address the pressing issues surrounding drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The documentary, available on YouTube, provides a platform for survivors to share their stories and experiences, emphasizing the need to listen to those directly affected by this widespread crisis. Inspired by the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Lugard recognized the absence of survivor narratives during these observances. “Drug Pandemic” seeks to give a voice to the victims, offering a unique perspective on the devastating effects of drug addiction. “I feel that each year when we observe the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, we don’t get to hear from the victims or survivors, even though they are the ones who have suffered from this pandemic called drug abuse. So, I believe that hearing from them would be a better way to mark the day because of their firsthand experience. Secondly, I want them to share their own stories themselves because it goes a long way in encouraging both the survivors and those still struggling to break free from the chains of addiction”, she said. Through in-depth interviews with survivors, Lugard has gained valuable insights into the realities of drug addiction. The key lessons highlighted in the documentary challenge common misconceptions and stereotypes associated with addiction. Lugard emphasizes that individuals grappling with drug abuse often suffer silently, burdened by societal stigma even after successfully overcoming addiction. “Some of the key lessons I have learned from the survivors featured in the documentary ‘Drug Pandemic’ are that most people suffering from drug addiction aren’t happy about their drug use; they simply can’t help themselves in overcoming it. These individuals have dreams as well, and they are constantly bothered by the stigma they face from society. Even after breaking free from their addiction, people still refer to them as drug addicts, which remains a major source of concern for them”, she added. One of the core misconceptions Lugard aims to challenge is the belief that addiction stems from a desire for pleasure. By shedding light on the complex relationship between addiction and mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, Lugard underscores the importance of understanding the multifaceted nature of addiction. The documentary’s primary goal is to create a profound impact, encouraging viewers to recognize the person behind the label of “drug addict.” Lugard emphasizes that individuals struggling with addiction possess a deep desire for change and require support rather than judgment. By advocating for rehabilitation and promoting education on the dangers of drug abuse, Lugard aims to shift the narrative from hopelessness to a belief in the transformative power of recovery. She said: “The impact I hope to achieve through the documentary is to make the viewer’s understand that beneath the label of ‘drug addict’ lies a person who despises their addiction and genuinely desires to change and become a better person. However, the individual’s willpower alone may not be sufficient to achieve that transformation. That is why rehabilitation requires a collective effort. The specific message I aim to convey to my viewers is that stigmatization is not the solution to drug addiction. Instead, we should show love and support to those who are suffering from addiction by educating them about the dangers of the drugs they are abusing. Many individuals struggling with addiction are unaware of the implications of their drug use. That’s why sensitization is crucial”. Throughout the documentary journey, Lugard encountered numerous memorable moments and stories that left a lasting impression. Among these was the inspiring tale of a survivor who triumphed over addiction while battling a kidney disease, having undergone a life-saving nephrectomy. Additionally, the poignant story of a man deeply affected by personal loss, leading to his substance addiction, resonated deeply with Lugard.
