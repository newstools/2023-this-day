The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that there would be significant development of local capacity in the course of the realisation of the Benin River Port project. Obaseki said this during the commemoration of the International Day of Seafarers. He noted that efforts to develop the port are on track and that relevant regulatory requirements are being followed. According to him, “as we commemorate the International Day of Seafarers, we reiterate that work on the Benin Port is on track and we are collaborating with the Nigeria Port Authority and other regulatory bodies to ensure that due process is followed. “One of the key things for us is the development of local capacity. Already we have the best of professionals in the shipping and maritime industry working with us on the project. “However, we want to use the opportunity of the development of the Benin Port to develop local talent in shipping and the maritime sector. We have already sent some of our young people to some of the best schools in the world to learn from the experts. “As we progress on this project, we intend that our youths will be provided with the opportunity to man key roles and ensure a very strong local content regime, which will avail our people the opportunities to build their capacity. “Other stakeholders with requisite expertise will also be given the opportunity to contribute to the development of the port, which will be built to International standard.” The state government is developing the Benin Port in collaboration with the federal government through the Nigeria Port Authority.
