Power is an influential force capable of changing even the strongest individuals. Unfortunately, this truth has often been overlooked by many, leading to their eventual downfall. Those involved with state governors, like Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, would be wise to heed this lesson, take necessary precautions, and safeguard their lives, status, and property before it’s too late. Reports from Kogi indicate that Governor Bello has decided to dismiss several officials, including the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. David Apeh, Special Adviser to the Governor on Emergency Management, Mr. Danladi Isah-Yunusa, and Maryam Salifu, Part-time Chairman of the Kogi State Hotels and Tourism Board. This move by Bello demonstrates his adherence to high standards, which may potentially lead to the replacement of a significant number of government officials in the state. Critics of the governor argue that the dismissals lack genuine justification. Despite the immediate implementation of these dismissals, no official reason was provided by the governor’s office. This has led skeptics to believe that Bello is merely asserting his power in a superficial display of authority. Regardless of the truth behind these dismissals, there are valuable lessons to be learned. Firstly, a governor like Bello, who refers to himself as a ‘White Lion,’ is unpredictable. Secondly, every smile he presents may conceal hidden motives, ready to strike if an individual falls short of his expectations. In such cases, the recipient of his wrath will be ruthlessly cut down without mercy. Numerous individuals have already experienced the consequences of this lesson. It is allegedly the reason why Bello is both respected and feared, solidifying his position as a tyrant across the 21 local government areas of the state in the hearts of many Kogites. However, with the upcoming Kogi State gubernatorial election, the tide may soon change, potentially surprising Bello and his supporters. Only time will tell if this prediction holds true or not.
