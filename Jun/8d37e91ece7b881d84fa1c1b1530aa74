The award ceremony for the Season 4 of the Dolphin Swimming League will take place on Saturday at Grange School, Ikeja, Lagos. Being the first inter-private school swimming competition, the league is organised by Dynaspro Promotion and Advanta Interactive with support from Rite Foods and it has been sanctioned by the Nigeria Aquatic Federation, Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF) as well as the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) with the aim of selecting outstanding swimmers from it for major competitions within and outside the shores of Nigeria. Exceptional swimmers for this season will be honoured at the colourful event expected to be attended by parents and guardians of the participating schools. According to the organisers, 25 awards would be given out to students, coaches and schools for their efforts this season. “We believe in rewarding outstanding swimmers and schools as well as coaches who have been exceptional in their performance and conduct on and off the pool. This is our own way of appreciating their efforts and also urging them to continue to work harder for future events. Some of our partners and supporters will also be honoured at the event for their unflinching backing of the league since its inception,” said Efe Ojigbede, CEO of Advanta Interactive. Also, the major sponsor of the league, Rite Foods would be present to make the event exciting and glamorous for the awardees.
