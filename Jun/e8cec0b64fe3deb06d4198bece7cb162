Former Super Eagles forward, Odion Ighalo, 34, whose football career is in its twilight has agreed to play in the Nigerian topflight league if certain conditions are met before hanging his boots. He’s currently a free agent after his contract with Saudi Arabia club Al-Hilal ended in May. Speaking on ElegbeteTV yesterday, Ighalo said: “I said if security is guaranteed, good coverage is assured and better officiating. Of course, (I will play). “I have played in the league before, and it will be a great privilege for me to play again for another six months or one year before I end my career.”
