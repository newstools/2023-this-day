According to him, “As at the last count, we recorded about 286 professors and about 25 associate professors some of whom will be glad to come and contribute their quota towards the growth of the university. “It is, therefore, heartwarming that the university is sited in Kabba, the headquarters of Kogi West senatorial district. As a senator who was privileged to serve Kogi West for three terms, I will be delighted to support any effort towards improving the well-being and Educational development of our people. “While many would have perhaps welcomed the idea had it come three to four years ago, my answer has always remained that it is better late thannever.”  “This has been the desire of our people and those of us who have been the vanguard for the upgrading of ABU College of Agriculture in Kabba to a full-fledged university, the proposed Kogi State University. It is a welcome development while we continue to await the upgrade. “There is no such thing as too many educational institutions, as our people stand to benefit from it, and for that reason, we acknowledge this gesture by the governor. “We will also continue to agitate for our bill before President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and I use this opportunity to appeal to him to graciously append his signature on the bill for the upgrade and expansion of the College of Agriculture, Kabba, to a full-fledged university.”
