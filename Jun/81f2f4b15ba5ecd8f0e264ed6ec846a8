Our sense of sight is responsible for most things we absorb into our bodies. That is why they say the eye is a window to the soul hence the utmost need to maintain our vision and give proper care to our eyes for overall eye health. The significance of maintaining our eyes as illustrated in the following factors, cannot be overemphasized. Vision Correction: Many individuals experience refractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related near vision decline). Eye care services, including comprehensive eye exams, enable accurate diagnosis of these conditions and the prescription of corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses. By addressing vision impairments, eye care services enhance visual acuity, enabling individuals to perform daily activities with ease and efficiency. Regular eye examinations play a crucial role in the early detection and treatment of various eye diseases. Conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and others can be asymptomatic in their early stages, making them difficult to detect without professional intervention. Eye care professionals can identify signs of these diseases during routine examinations, enabling timely intervention and management to prevent further vision loss or complications. Prevention and Management of Eye Conditions: Eye care services encompass preventative measures aimed at reducing the risk of eye-related problems. For instance, eye care professionals can provide guidance on proper eye hygiene, including recommendations for handwashing and avoiding eye trauma. Additionally, they can educate patients about lifestyle factors, such as nutrition, regular exercise, and protection from ultraviolet radiation, which contribute to maintaining good eye health. Furthermore, eye care services facilitate the management of chronic conditions like dry eye syndrome, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis, offering relief and preventing potential complications. Individuals with existing eye conditions or those at risk due to age, family history, or other factors require ongoing monitoring to ensure optimal eye health. Eye care services enable regular check-ups and monitoring of conditions, facilitating timely adjustments to treatment plans when necessary. Monitoring can also involve the assessment of eye-related side effects of systemic health conditions and medications, allowing for early detection and management of potential complications. Quality of Life Improvement: Good vision is vital for maintaining an individual’s independence, productivity, and overall quality of life. Eye care services help individuals achieve and preserve clear vision, allowing them to perform daily tasks effectively, excel in their professions, and engage in recreational activities without limitations. Additionally, maintaining good eye health contributes to overall well-being, as visual impairments can impact mental health, social interactions, and overall satisfaction with life. Early detection and treatment of eye conditions in children are crucial for their visual development and academic success. Regular eye exams help identify refractive errors, amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), and other conditions that, if left unaddressed, can lead to permanent vision loss or developmental delays. Eye care services for children often include vision screening programs in schools or pediatric eye exams, ensuring that potential issues are identified early and appropriate interventions are implemented. In recognition that most eye conditions were preventable through proper care and regular eye checks, Seplat Energy, a Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian and London stock exchanges with assets in the Niger Delta birthed a remarkable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ‘Eye Can See’ initiative. This initiative is being carried out in partnership with the NNPC Exploration & Production Limited. The initiative was introduced to help reduce the risks of eye blindness. The ‘Eye Can See’ initiative focuses on bringing free, qualitative, and comprehensive eye care to members of its host communities. The meaning of ‘eye can see’ can be said to be a way of making sure that the eyes carry out their functions which are known as seeing/vision, clarity. Since its inception in 2012, the ‘Eye Can See’ programme has left an indelible mark on the lives of many. It has brought light to the eyes that were once shrouded in darkness, offering hope and renewed vision. With unwavering dedication, the programme has treated a staggering 96,211 individuals, provided 45,074 pairs of reading glasses, and performed 4,218 life-changing eye surgeries. Through this CSR initiative Seplat Energy has demonstrated its commitment to the well-being of community members, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged. This outreach has promoted positive relationships between Seplat and the communities in Edo, Delta, and Lagos; all of which are the states where this outreach is being carried out. This in turn is building trust, putting smiles on the faces of individuals, and encouraging individuals to seek medical attention when needed. Testimonies Abound: In separate interviews, some beneficiaries of the programme and other stakeholders, spoke to the impacts of the Eye Can See initiative and how it has changed their lives tremendously. For Rev. Mrs. Elizabeth Emuobor, who had a surgery in one of her eyes when Seplat Energy deployed the Eye Can See programme at Ugboren Community in Delta State in 2018, the intervention brough hope to her situation. She said the surgery done on one of her eyes due to a Cataract disease, happened after she had visited many hospitals, which had demanded for payments before the treatment could happen. She said: “Seplat’s intervention was a great help for me. I had visited several hospitals and I was told to make payments. Seplat really did well by coming to my aid. The surgery was done on me without any payment. They restored by sight free of charge. “If other companies are acting the way Seplat does, the country will be better for it; people will be happy. At 80, I am still strong and going to market. I would have been blind today if not for Seplat’s intervention. Another beneficiary, Benson Eberuwenvwi, said in 2020 a surgery was done on one of his eyes during the Seplat Eye Can See programme. “I couldn’t see with it then. Now, I can see clearly with it. I go about my business; I am so happy and grateful to Seplat Energy.” Chiagozie Nelson, a 11-year-old beneficiary who had cataract in both eyes, said since last year when the surgery was performed on his eyes, he has been seeing properly. “Before I had to touch things to properly identify what they are. I couldn’t see clearly in class. I couldn’t walk alone. I couldn’t walk under the sun. But now, I can see, I can play and I can do everything. “I perform better in class now. I can only thank Seplat for the surgery and bringing my sight back.” Mr. Linus Mba (A Consultant Refereeing for Nigeria Football Federation and FIFA Technical Adviser – Refereeing) is another beneficiary. He had surgery on his left and right eyes in 2014 and 2017 respectively under the Seplat Eye Can See programme. Mba said: “My coming to Sapele Delta State for the surgery changed my life for good. I was finding it very difficult to see before the surgery. The timely intervention of Seplat saved me. I could have really had difficulties living. I am still very active as at today. I still publish a magazine on football refereeing. “I can only appreciate Seplat for making it possible for me to still see my eyes. May God continue to bless the company and all its people.” Mr. Bassey Etim Bassey, a Petroleum Engineer with the NNPC Exploration and Production Limited (NEPL), partners in the Seplat Joint Venture, described the Eye Can See programme as a very impactful programme that has tremendously touched many lives. According to him, the impacts of the programme are immediate and long-term. “The programme gives hope to people in our communities; you see the joy and glow on people’s faces. It’s so heart-warming and fulfilling. This is one of the best CSR programmes for us. NEPL will always support this programme,” he assured. The Director, External Affairs and Sustainability, Chioma Afe, describes the ‘Eye Can See’ initiative as a flagship programme of Seplat Energy in its quest to bringing smiles on the faces of the people in its host communities. She says the programme is targeted at men, women and children with various eye problems, explaining that Seplat Energy intends to provide free optical treatment at all levels to members of the communities, prevent and reduce cases of permanent loss of vision, provide free reading glasses and treat other related eye problems, educate patients on ways to care for their eyes and how to detect Cataract, Glaucoma, etc educate patients on lifestyle change to reduce the rates of Hypertension & Diabetes. Seplat Energy, a renowned company known for its commitment to life-changing Corporate Social Responsibility programmes in the areas of health, education and entrepreneurship development, among others, remains dedicated to this cause and continues to make significant impact on the lives of those affected by visual impairment. The positive outcomes and transformative effects the programme had had on the lives of many Nigerians (directly and indirectly) have generated anticipation for the upcoming 2023 edition of the programme, as Seplat Energy remains committed to touching more lives and giving hope to those with special needs.
