What is Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State always looking for at the Presidential Villa? This is one question many analysts are asking. Since President Bola Tinubu assumed power, the governor is a regular face in the federal seat of power. Not even Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State who manages the biggest economy in the country, and who is the closest to the president runs to the Villa the way Uzodimma does. This is why many are wondering what he is always looking for. Since he became governor in January 2020, his state has become the hotbed of insecurity in the South-east. Even though the security situation in the state has slightly improved, a lot still needs to be done. The Imo State governor has been accused by his political opponents of not concentrating on governing the state. They alleged that he is always unavailable to solve the challenges facing the state. It is surprising that the Imo State governor who will face the electorate in the November governorship election is busy gallivanting. It is not in doubt that once in a while governors visit the president to brief him on issues concerning their states.  But Uzodimma’s trip to the Villa has allegedly become too frequent. At the decoration of the new Acting Inspector General of Police and his assumption of office last week, the Imo State governor was the only state chief executive officer at the event. The opposition political parties in the state have alleged that rather than use the achievements in the state, the governor is busy courting the high and mighty in Abuja in order to use the federal might to facilitate his re-election.
