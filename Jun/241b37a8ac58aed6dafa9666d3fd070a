French giants, PSG, are set to take their first major step towards signing Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, which could trigger a potential frenzy of transfer offers.   The prolific striker has captured the attention of numerous top European clubs in the last three months with Chelsea and Manchester United emerging as frontrunners due to Osimhen’s expressed admiration for the English Premier League.  However, according to soccernet.ng, PSG remain undeterred in their pursuit, particularly following the departure of Lionel Messi and the looming possibility of Kylian Mbappe joining Real Madrid this summer.  The Ligue 1 champions are considering substantially restructuring their attacking lineup, with Osimhen at the forefront of their plans.  And renowned transfer market expert Ekrem Konur has revealed that PSG are contemplating making an opening bid for the Nigerian sensation.  Despite this interest, recent reports indicate that Napoli, Osimhen’s current club, will entertain offers no less than their valuation of €180 million for the 24-year-old striker.  Osimhen’s market value has skyrocketed, cementing his status as the most valuable player in the history of the Italian Serie A. The Nigerian hit the remarkable €120 million mark in the latest update by Transfermarkt.  This exponential increase in his stock can be attributed to his remarkable tally of 26 goals, which was pivotal in propelling Napoli to their first Scudetto triumph in 33 years.  Consequently, Osimhen etched his name in history as the highest-scoring African player in the Italian top flight.
