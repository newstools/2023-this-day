Super Eagles Striker, Taiwo Awoniyi has insisted that his transfer to Nottingham Forest was a good move for both parties.  The Nigeria international swapped Union Berlin for the two-time European champions last summer, signing a deal that will keep him at the City Ground until June 30, 2027. Awoniyi was Nottingham Forest’s most expensive acquisition in history as at the time he joined the club, before the transfer record was broken by Morgan Gibbs-White, who was bought from Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Although Awoniyi netted match-winning goals against West Ham United and Liverpool, in truth, he struggled in the earlier part of last season just like everyone else at Nottingham Forest because he had not adapted to the demands of the English Premier League after his move from the German Bundesliga. Having recovered from an injury that sidelined him for three months, the Super Eagles striker was in the form of his life at the tail end of the season, scoring braces against Southampton and Chelsea, which built up his confidence, before strikes against Arsenal and Crystal Palace.  When asked if he made the wrong move to Forest, Awoniyi told Brila FM: “The truth is everyone has their opinion; now everyone is saying wow I made a good season, If I had stayed in my former club no one would have known how important I would have been for Nottingham Forest. “My advice for everyone is not to look into people’s ideas and just keep on believing in them and keep on praying for them regardless of what move they make.” Reacting to competition for places in the Super Eagles squad when it comes to the striker positions.  He responded: “There are a lot of hot strikers. Victor Osimhen look at what he did in Napoli. Is it Kelechi Iheanacho, is it Moffi? Every Nigerian striker is hot.” Against Sierra Leone in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Sunday, June 18, Awoniyi is aiming to make his first start for the Super Eagles in 511 days.  Ifeanyi Emmanuel
