Last week, we started a topic on Postpartum Endometritis. We defined and discussed the causes and symptoms. This week, we conclude with diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of postpartum endometritis. DIAGNOSIS OF POSTPARTUM ENDOMETRITIS TREATMENT OF POSTPARTUM ENDOMETRITIS Hospitalization may be indicated in severe cases of postpartum endometritis. This makes it possible to keep a careful eye on the mother’s health and guarantees that intravenous antibiotics and supportive care are given in the right way. If the patient has other difficulties or risk factors, hospitalization can also be necessary. PREVENTION OF POSTPARTUM ENDOMETRITIS CONCLUSION Endometritis may seem a complicated health issue post-delivery, severity and occurrence may however be reduced if a woman immediately reports when she starts  to feel warm, particularly tender, or have a foul discharge even when she has been discharged home. Although discomfort or tenderness does not always indicate an oncoming infection, it is still better that a thorough examination be done to rule out Endometritis.
