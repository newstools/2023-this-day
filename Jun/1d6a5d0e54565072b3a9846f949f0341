Divine Nwachukwu admits no-one was more surprised than him at receiving a maiden call-up to the Nigeria squad for their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sierra Leone on Sunday. The 20-year-old attacking midfielder was one of four home-based players included in Jose Peseiro’s 23-man roster as reward for his fine performances in the colours of Bendel Insurance. Nwachukwu contributed one goal and five assists to help the Vipers finish top of Group A at the end of the regular season and scored three times during the Nigeria Professional Football League playoffs to catch the eye of Peseiro. The youngster represented his country at the Under-17 level, but revealed his journey since then has been a struggle and expressed pride at getting the nod by the Super Eagles head coach. “I feel amazing, what can I say? I am more than happy right now. When I got the text, I thought it was a joke,” he said of the invitation to join the senior national team. “I feel very amazing and I feel proud of myself and what I have done. It has been one rough journey for me. I have been in the U20, U23 squads but in the end, I got kicked out. “To play for Bendel Insurance at my age and to do what I have done is amazing and at least I got a reward. The coach saw me and picked me. It is a plus for me and I am very happy for that.”
