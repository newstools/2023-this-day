The measure of success often hinges on perception. When individuals are recognised for their significant contributions, their success stories are expected to follow suit. In line with this, Women Radio 91.7 FM is gearing up to host its inaugural ReportHer Awards, honouring outstanding contributors in the field of gender-balanced news reporting. The landscape of national journalism in Nigeria has been intriguing. Despite the country’s physical, economic, and socio-cultural distance from the West, it has managed to achieve a degree of fairness in news coverage, as observed in the Western context. Women Radio, the largest radio station focused on family-themed content in Nigeria, is leaving no stone unturned in inviting esteemed guests to its awards ceremony. Based on reports gathered thus far, Women Radio aims to recognize some of the most influential voices and faces that are making an impact in the field of reporting in Nigeria. The ReportHer Awards, centred around gender balance in reportage, will acknowledge the work of various media organisations actively involved in journalistic efforts related to women. Through this gender-focused reporting award, Women Radio offers journalists and media organisations the opportunity to stand out and be celebrated for portraying women in a positive light. The ReportHer Awards will encompass five categories: Television, Radio, Print, Digital, and Journalist. Set to take place on Saturday, July 8, 2023, the Reporter Awards have garnered support from influential organisations such as the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism and UN Women. It is an event of significant magnitude that should not be overlooked or forgotten. Furthermore, it is worth noting that Women Radio was established by Dr. Babatunde Okewale and holds the distinction of being Nigeria’s first radio station dedicated to women and family matters. Therefore, an award ceremony organised by the station is a significant undertaking that will undoubtedly attract notable dignitaries.
