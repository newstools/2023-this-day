Manchester City’s imminent signing of Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic and Ilkay Gundogan’s departureare the first changes to the squad which landed last season’s Treble – but are unlikely to be the last. The 29-year-old Croatia international – who will arrive for an initial fee of £25m,potentially rising to £30m – looked like he would boost City’s options in the heart of midfield. But just hours later, the news came out that German midfielder Gundogan would be joining Barcelonathis summer on a free transfer – making the reasons for Kovacic’s signing a lot clearer. Kovacic played 69 passes per 90 minutes last season – the fifth-highest total in the Premier League among central midfielders who played regularly.
