Chinedu Eze The management of International Aviation College (IAC), Ilorin has decorated five graduating students who have completed their commercial and private pilot licence courses. This is just as the Acting Rector of the College, Capt. Yakubu Okatahi has appealed to the Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman Abdulrasaq to come to the aid of the college in order for it to remain in operation. He stressed the need for adequate funding to prevent the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) from shutting the school down for not meeting standards. Okatahi and other officials of the college also commended the governor for the regular subvention to the college which has enabled the school to remain in operation. According to Okatahi, the governor’s recent release of N75 million, enabled the college to purchase a new aircraft engine and propeller, 10,000 litres of jet-A1, and repair of the college’s fuel dump, among others. The Rector however appealed to the governor for increased funding of the college to enable it meet with all the requirements stipulated by the regulatory authority. He said the college can do better with sufficient funding by the State Government.
