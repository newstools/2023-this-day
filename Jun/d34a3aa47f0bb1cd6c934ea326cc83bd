Nosa Alekuogie As more states announced the reduction of the number of workdays that civil and public servants will have to commute to their workplaces from five days a week to three days, the federal and state governments have been urged to adopt Konn3ct virtual conferencing solution for remote activities.  Kwara and Edo states recently took proactive steps to reduce the numbers of working days from five to three in order to reduce the pains and ameliorate the sufferings of civil servants due to the removal of fuel subsidy by the federal government.  Similarly, for teachers and parents, their commuting to school will be reduced as Edo State in particular is working on deepening the EdoBEST@Home initiative to create more virtual classrooms, thereby reducing the cost of commuting on parents, teachers and pupils. Given the scenarios above, the Managing Director of the New Waves Eco-Systems, the developer of Konn3ct platform, Mr. Femi Williams, has appealed to the federal and state governments to adopt the Konn3ct virtual conferencing platform for its virtual engagements, adding that the National Policy of Virtual Engagement favours indigenous solutions. The recently adopted National Policy on Virtual Engagements in the federal public institutions seeks to institutionalise frameworks and standards within Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government as well as publicly owned companies using virtual engagement as an administrative procedure in service. The policy, according to Williams, will help the Head of Service to adopt the best technology available that guarantees versatility, interoperability, and security of government information and data, in line with the provisions of the Nigeria Cloud Computing Policy and the Guidelines for Digital Asset Management in Public Institutions.
