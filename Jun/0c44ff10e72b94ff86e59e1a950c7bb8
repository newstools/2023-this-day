MASON MOUNT Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign England midfielder Mason Mount from Chelsea on a five-year contract for £55m, plus £5m in add-ons. Mount, 24, will be Erik ten Hag’s first signing of the summer as he looks to strengthen his side following United’s qualification for next season’s Champions League. Chelsea spent £600m last season and needed to sell before 30 June to ease Financial Fair Play concerns. Mount joined Chelsea aged six. Chelsea had rejected United’s first three bids but talks between the two clubs resumed this week to resolve the impasse. It is understood Chelsea preferred not to lose Mount but were unable to successfully negotiate a new contract with his deal set to expire next year. Mount, who has scored 33 goals in 195 appearances for Chelsea since making his senior debut in 2019, missed the end of the domestic season with injury as the Blues came 12th – their lowest finish for more than 25 years. COLEMAN Seamus Coleman has signed a new one-year deal with Everton until the end of June 2024. The Republic of Ireland right-back, 34, was appointed club captain in 2019 and is the Toffees’ longest-serving current player. He has made 409 appearances for Everton since joining from Sligo Rovers in 2009. Coleman will begin his 15th season at Goodison Park after he recovers from a knee injury sustained in May. “Everyone knows how much Everton means to me which is why it is special to sign this new contract and continue to play for this great club,” said Coleman. “From the moment I joined more than 14 years ago, the support my family and I have had from our fans and everyone around the club has been amazing and I never take for granted just how fortunate I am to represent Everton. “That has included the honour of wearing the captain’s armband in recent years.” The Toffees narrowly avoided relegation last season, finishing just two points above the drop zone.
