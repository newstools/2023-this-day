*Ranked 6th best in Africa, 39th globally Duro Ikhazuagbe  Following Nigeria’s improved rating in the latest FIFA Ranking released yesterday, the Super Eagles will be one of the top seeds for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying tournament when the draw is staged on July 12. The three-time African champions moved up a step in the June ranking released yesterday by FIFA to 6th in Africa and 39th in the globally ranking. Already, the world governing body issued a statement insisting that FIFA Rankings will be used to seed teams for the 2025 FIFA World Cup draw next month. In the latest ranking released, Morocco remained Africa’s top team as they are 13th in the world. Continental champions Senegal are second and rated 18th globally. Tunisia third in Africa are 31st in the world while Algeria are 33rd and Egypt 34th. The other teams in the Top 9 include: Cameroon (7th), Mali (8th) and Cote d’Ivoire (9th). As top seeds, Nigeria are expected to avoid all these teams as nine teams will represent Africa at the World Cup Tomé jointly hosted in USA, Mexico and Canada with an additional team also getting a chance to playoff for a spot. But there are some teams outside the Top 9 like Ghana, who eliminated Nigeria from the 2022 World Cup, South Africa and Burkina Faso, who could pose a danger to the World Cup ambitions of the seeded teams. In the month under review, the Eagles beat Sierra Leone 3-2 to qualify for the 2023 AFCON to be hosted by Cote d’Ivoire in January next year.
