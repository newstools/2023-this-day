Funmi Ogundare  The Managing Director of SKLD Integrated Services Limited, Mrs. Temilola Adepetun, and Casio have called for sanctions against peddlers of fake products especially fake calculators and educational products imported into the country.  Adepetun, who said this in Lagos recently at a conference designed to showcase CASIO’s dedicated efforts in advancing education within Nigeria, expressed concern that the country has become a dumping ground.  “I am not sure how far the Standard Organization of Nigeria ( SON) are enforcing the laws. How much of quality assurance are they doing? How many parastatals do they have that are controlling the quality of things that are brought in or imported into Nigeria? What are the customs doing? Do they have quality control department?” stated Adepetun. “In the case of examination bodies, what are they doing? Are they adopting the authentic calculator? Are they allowing the students to use just any calculator?” The managing director expressed concern that the fake calculators give wrong answers, adding that it’s time the country begins to sanitise the education materials from the top. The Education Specialist at Casio in Japan, Koichi Danjo, explained that his organisation proposed a new way of studying mathematics with a scientific calculator uncommon in Nigeria. He disclosed that last year, his organisation did a pilot project on six schools in Lagos, where they found out that the results of students using scientific calculators in the same subject, compared to non-users, were higher.
