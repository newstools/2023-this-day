James Emejo in Abuja  The National Action on Sugar Reduction Coalition (NASR), has called on President Bola Tinubu-led administration to increase the sugar-sweetened beverage tax in the interest of Nigerians and the economy at large. The coalition has been advocating for pro-health policies, including the passage of Nigeria’s N10 per litre excise tax in the 2021 Finance Act. Speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting in Abuja, coalition members maintained that the tax, by deterring the purchase and consumption of harmful sugary beverages, will reap health benefits by preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially among the urban poor who cannot afford the high cost of treatment. Responding, however, President, Nigeria Cancer Society (NCS)/Co-Chairman, NASR Coalition, Dr Adamu Alhassan Umar, said, “The reason for taxing these ‘sin commodities’ is to preserve Nigerians’ health and well-being, as they contribute to the country’s rising non-communicable disease toll. “Removing sin taxes will shift an increasing budgetary burden on the underfunded health-care sector, rendering the tax reversal counterproductive.” Also, the National Secretary, Diabetes Association of Nigeria, Mr. Bernard Enyia, urged the new administration to as a matter of urgency, prioritise the implementation of the policy on sugar tax and raise it from N10 per litre to N30 per litre. A member of the coalition/Executive Director of Bundies Care Support Initiative, Funmi Adefila-Osiegbu, said a sugar-sweetened beverage tax can increase revenue for the health sector as well as be used to improve social insurance. She said, “I will recommend that there should be an increase in public awareness on all fronts of the unhealthy impact of sugar-sweetened beverages and the benefits of imposing SSB taxes for the benefit of all.”
