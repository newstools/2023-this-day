Whether in setting up the Ballers or Vegas Lounge in Ebonyi and Abuja respectively, or even at Anan World Clothing and Accessories, Chief Kester Agwu is driven by excellence. But it is as Chief Executive Officer, Tastia Restaurant, Bakery and Cafe he takes pride in offering the finest quality food, confectionaries and exceptional service. With seven branches all over Abuja, Tastia is a brand known for consistently delivering quality and taste. This, Agwu believes is in line with his commitment to excellence which sets them apart and keeps customers coming back for more. Beyond the food, Agwu, who employs over 1,000 staff across board, particularly pays attention to aesthetic as his  bubbling 250-seater restaurant and bakery in Wuse 2, the largest so far in Abuja, caters for VIPS and regulars. Amongst other things, he tells Chiemelie Ezeobi that even though his venture into the culinary and hospitality world started off with a lounge, he has since found his niche in catering to the taste buds of Nigerians  What distinguishes your establishment as a cutting-edge dining experience, and what compelling reasons should attract patrons to choose your establishment over neighboring restaurants?  At our establishment, we pride ourselves on offering the finest quality food and exceptional service. Our diverse menu ensures that we cater to a wide range of tastes and preferences. We understand that in the food industry, taste and quality are paramount, and we have consistently delivered on both fronts. Our commitment to excellence sets us apart and keeps customers coming back for more. What factors influence the choice of a meal, particularly with regards to taste preferences? Additionally, could you share the story of how you ventured into this field? The concept of “taste” in our establishment is closely tied to the name itself, which was coined from the word “Tastia.” When I initially entered the food industry, I operated a lounge in Gwarimpa approximately four years ago. However, we encountered challenges with development control, leading to the demolition of the premises. During that time, there was also a restaurant within the lounge. Reflecting on the experience, I realized that running a restaurant provided a sense of tranquility and peace of mind. Consequently, I made the decision to focus on establishing a restaurant rather than continuing with the club/lounge format. When did both businesses start? I established my first lounge in 2012 and later opened another one in Abakaliki in 2016. Following that, I ventured into the restaurant industry with the launch of Vegas Restaurant and Bakery. Initially, I also operated Vegas Food Store, situated in a location facing the market in Gwarinpa. However, after observing that most customers would stop by to pick up items and then proceed to the market for their shopping, I made the decision to close down the store. It was during this time that I received inspiration from the Holy Spirit to transform the space into a restaurant. Hence, I shifted my focus to establishing a restaurant. Originally, I planned to name it Vegas Restaurant and Bakery, but considering the presence of Vegas Resorts and Lounge on the same road, along with Vegas Foodstuff, I decided to rebrand and renamed it Tastia. How has the journey been thus far? For Tastia we have seven branches and for Vegas we have one and we have over a thousand staff. The journey hasn’t been easy but we thank God. It has to do with God, God has been our strength all the way because it has not been easy managing staff, government levies, FIRS, but we thank God for where we are today and putting our best and all that. How would you characterise your management style? I am grateful to have an exceptional team of staff members who have been the cornerstone of my business. One of the key factors contributing to our success is the strong and positive working relationships I maintain with each member of my team. We prioritise fair and competitive wages for our staff, and we make an effort to support them by addressing any issues or challenges they may encounter. By doing so, we foster an environment where they are motivated to give their best in fulfilling their responsibilities. What is your approach to marketing and what strategies do you employ? When we go out to the market, we have a dedicated marketing team. With their support, we are able to reach a wide range of customers who appreciate the taste and quality of our food. Our extensive customer base plays a crucial role in spreading the word about our business. Their satisfaction with our products encourages them to recommend us to others, helping us expand our reach even further. Do you offer outside catering services? Yes, we do cater for weddings, parties, and other events. Our catering services are available for various occasions, providing delicious food and exceptional service to make every event memorable. Whether it’s a wedding reception, birthday party, or any other celebration, we ensure that our food and presentation exceed expectations. Our team of experienced professionals is dedicated to creating a delightful culinary experience for all our customers. You can rely on us to handle the catering aspect of your special occasion with expertise and attention to detail. Do you have both internal and external quality control measures in place to ensure consistent quality standards? Yes, we have a dedicated Quality Control department that ensures the highest standards for everything that leaves our facility. Our Quality Control team meticulously examines every product to guarantee its adherence to our rigorous quality standards. By implementing stringent quality control measures, we maintain consistency and excellence in all our offerings. This commitment to quality is what sets us apart and earns the trust of our customers. You can be confident that every item you receive from us has undergone thorough inspection and meets our strict quality criteria. Could you please share your upbringing and how it has shaped you? I completed my education at the University of Uyo. Initially, I pursued a diploma in International Relations, and later I pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Education. I successfully finished my studies in 2002 and 2003, after which I ventured into the business field. Coincidentally, my elder brother resides in the USA and had connections in China for importing. Taking advantage of this opportunity, we began importing in containers and supplying them. However, after a few months, I realised that this business wasn’t something I could excel in. Consequently, I made the decision to shift my focus to clothing. In 2003, I traveled to China and started importing clothes and shoes. This endeavor gradually expanded, leading us to establish 15 outlets in Abuja. At one point, we were recognised as the largest fashion store in the city. Unfortunately, due to the fluctuating exchange rates, there was a decline in people purchasing clothes. To adapt to the changing market conditions, I diversified my business ventures. I opened a lounge and later ventured into the restaurant industry as well. These additional ventures provided stability and allowed me to cater to different customer preferences and demands. Could you provide an overview of your current activities and any other areas or endeavors you are involved or invested in? I currently own and operate multiple establishments, namely Tastia, Vegas, and Anan World. Additionally, I have a lounge in Abakaliki called Ballers. To ensure smooth operations, I appointed managers to oversee each branch, and there is also a general manager who reports directly to me.  Each of these establishments offers unique experiences and caters to different preferences. Tastia, Vegas, and Anan World have their distinct atmospheres and offerings, providing customers with a diverse range of options. Meanwhile, Ballers in Abakaliki serves as a trendy lounge where patrons can relax and enjoy their evenings. With capable managers in place, I can effectively delegate responsibilities and ensure that each branch operates efficiently. The general manager serves as a point of contact for all branches, overseeing their performance and providing regular updates to me. This organisational structure allows me to focus on the broader aspects of the business while ensuring that each establishment receives the necessary attention and guidance. In the face of challenges that might have caused others to give up, what factors or motivations have driven you to persevere? I may have faced challenges, but I don’t let them weigh me down. I don’t take them to heart. One thing that works for me is constantly reminding myself that I must always strive for success. Instead of viewing them as obstacles, I see challenges as opportunities to grow my brand. This mindset helps me avoid dwelling on them and accept them as a natural part of life’s phases. Is it true that Tastia is regarded as the largest restaurant in Abuja? It’s true that our restaurant has a capacity of 250 people, and I haven’t come across any other restaurant in Nigeria that is bigger than ours. Additionally, we take pride in offering the largest variety of food in the country, featuring both local and continental cuisine. Could you provide information regarding the pricing for this budget? We have invested over 500 million naira, close to 600 million naira or even more, in putting this place together. Our expenses include the cost of equipment, utensils, and the construction of the building itself. We spared no expense in creating a well-equipped and functional establishment. Is the pricing at your establishment considered affordable and accessible for the average individual to dine at? Yes, our restaurant is very pocket-friendly, and this is one of the reasons for our large customer base. We prioritise providing value and quality without being greedy. We strive to offer the best service and our prices are very affordable, appealing to a wide range of customers. How do you address the issue of power supply? I heard that you manage to provide approximately 20 hours of continuous electricity. One of the challenges we face is power outage. There are days when we experience prolonged periods without electricity, and we have to rely on running our generator for 24 hours. It can be quite expensive considering the current cost of diesel, especially since our generator consumes 725 liters per cycle. Dealing with power issues in this area can be extremely challenging and demanding. What measures do you believe the government can implement to support business owners and mitigate the impact of various challenges, such as tax policies? Additionally, have you encountered any instances of multiple taxation within your business operations? One of our challenges is dealing with the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) when it comes to taxation. We have approximately 26 AMAC bodies that come for taxes, but on top of that, there are also fake ones that try to collect taxes from us. The number of fake bodies actually surpasses the number of genuine ones, sometimes resulting in up to 70 AMAC bodies visiting our store. It becomes problematic because we end up paying to the wrong entities and then the genuine ones demand payment as well. It’s a major issue, and the government has been working on finding a solution, but it’s not an easy task. Interacting with the AMAC officials can be chaotic as they disrupt businesses and even force the closure of many establishments, which is unfortunate. In addition to addressing taxation challenges, the government should focus on stabilizing the power supply and reducing the 12.5% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate, which seems excessively high. When customers visit our restaurant and the additional tax is added to their bill, it can make them feel displeased, and some may choose not to return. Furthermore, the government should consider providing loans and grants with lower interest rates, as the current rates from banks are too high. This support would greatly benefit businesses like ours and stimulate growth in the industry. What advice would you give to aspiring young men and women who wish to enter this business? Additionally, what are some common pitfalls they should be mindful of and avoid? First and foremost, aspiring restaurateurs should have a clear vision of what they want to achieve. It’s crucial to be passionate about the restaurant business because it’s not a venture one can simply wake up and jump into. To succeed, one must be fully committed and actively involved in the day-to-day operations. Entrusting the business to others and only occasionally checking in can lead to mistakes and shortcomings. In what ways have you contributed back to society, considering the blessings you have received? At our restaurant, we actively engage in various charitable initiatives. One of our notable programs is a scholarship scheme that supports 40 individuals from less privileged backgrounds. Whenever I feel moved by compassion or a sense of guidance from the Holy Spirit, I make it a priority to extend help through these initiatives. Giving back to the community is an integral part of our mission, and we are involved in numerous other acts of generosity as well. Given your background in political science, do you have any intentions or aspirations to pursue a career in politics and potentially run for political office? For now, no. Did you receive formal culinary training to acquire your cooking skills? Yes, I am currently enrolled in a 12-month diploma program at RED DISH Culinary School. The training I am undergoing there is providing me with valuable culinary skills and knowledge. I believe that investing in professional education is essential for further developing my abilities and advancing my career in the culinary industry. The comprehensive curriculum at RED DISH Culinary School is equipping me with the necessary expertise to excel in the field. What is the rationale behind producing your own water and juice in-house? We place great emphasis on ensuring the quality of what we offer to our customers, particularly when it comes to our juices. Recently, we have taken the initiative to produce our own water, although we still carry other water brands as well. The reason behind this decision is to have complete control and accountability over the products we serve. By producing our own water, we can better investigate and address any issues that may arise, ensuring the highest standards of safety and quality for our customers. How do you balance work and recreation? I lead a busy lifestyle as I engage in various activities. Apart from playing football and attending school, I also enjoy going to clubs. However, I am able to maintain a balanced lifestyle because I have capable individuals who assist me with many tasks. It’s important to note that the workload is not solely on my shoulders, as I have a supportive team that helps me manage and delegate responsibilities effectively. This allows me to pursue my interests while still fulfilling my commitments in different areas of my life.
