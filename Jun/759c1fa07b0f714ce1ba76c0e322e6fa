Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja As part of the continuation of his developmental strides in the state, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has flagged off the reconstruction of the 13.71 kilometers Itakpe-Kabba Junction-Total road in Okene, Kogi Central senatorial district of the state. The governor, while flagging of the road project, reassured the people of Kogi Central and the state in general that he would stop at nothing to ensure that he delivers quality infrastructure to all parts of the state. Bello explained that although the road is a federal road, due to the economic importance of the road to the people of the state as well as commuters who travel through the state, he would construct it. He said “From this point to Kabba Junction to Total, spanning 13.7 kilometers, it is a federal road, and over the years, we have made a lot of requests to the previous administration and it all fell into deaf ears.”  “We deem it necessary that even though the road fell in between our land but all Nigerians are using it and each time they pass through it, it gives us a bag image, so we decided to rehabilitate it and give it a befitting and standard quality. Bello told residents and road users that the road would be completed before the end of the year. While delivering his welcome address, the state Commissioner for Works and Housing, Hon. Samson Bako, explained that the road has inflicted so much pains on the people, adding that the deplorable state of the road has left users with no other option than to desert the road and look for alternative route. Bako pledged his support to the realisation of the project and all other ongoing projects across the state.
