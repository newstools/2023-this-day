Carlos Alcaraz won his first title on grass and regained the world number one ranking with an impressive victory over Alex de Minaur in the Queen’s final. Alcaraz’s 6-4 6-4 triumph means he moves above Novak Djokovic in the rankings and will be the top men’s seed at Wimbledon, which starts on 3 July. The Spaniard, 20 was playing only his third grass-court tournament. “So many legends have won here. Seeing my name on the trophy surrounded by the great champions is amazing,” he said. Alcaraz will now hope to emulate his compatriot Rafael Nadal, who triumphed at Queen’s in 2008 before going on to win Wimbledon for the first time a few weeks later. There were questions about Alcaraz’s ability on grass at the start of the week but he answered those in emphatic style, becoming a crowd favourite with his attacking play, humble attitude and boyish smile. He will now be considered the main threat to Djokovic’s defence of his Wimbledon crown. “It helps a lot to be top seed at Wimbledon,” said Alcaraz. “It’s amazing. It wouldn’t be possible without the support of the people through the whole week. “I started the tournament not really well, I had to adapt my movement a bit on grass,” he said. “But it’s been an amazing week and it’s ending with a lot of energy and on a high. “I have played 11 matches in my career on grass, so I have to get more experience, more hours. “But obviously after beating amazing guys, great players, and the level that I played, I consider myself one of the favourites – or one of the players to be able – to win Wimbledon.”
