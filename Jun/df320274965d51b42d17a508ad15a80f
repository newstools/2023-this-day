New Celtic coach, Brendan Rodgers, is looking to acquire Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, from Leicester City. Leicester City had an abysmal campaign last season, finishing 18th in the Premier League to suffer relegation to the Championship. They had three different managers last season. Rodgers was sacked in April, then Mike Stowell and Adam Sadler served as interim managers for two games, before Dean Smith was employed for the remaining eight games of the season. Super Eagles midfielder Ndidi had an average campaign, as he was plagued with injuries.  The 26-year-old defensive midfield made 27 Premier League appearances for the Foxes, 11 of which were off the bench. Rodgers just joined Celtic after Ange Postecoglou left for Tottenham, and according to Come on Leicester, Ndidi is a top target for the former Leicester City boss. Ndidi shone under Rodgers while he was at the club. The Nigerian reached his highest valuation while the former Liverpool gaffer was at the club. However, a deal may not take place as Ndidi’s £32million valuation may be too much for the Scottish champions to meet. Nonetheless, Ndidi still has one year left on his deal at the King Power, and they may be forced to sell if he does not extend his contract. In a related development, the Super Eagles midfielder has caught the attention of former Saudi Arabia Premier League champions Al-Shabab FC, according to soccernet.ng. The club has expressed interest in signing Ndidi, currently under contract with Leicester City until 2024. Leicester acquired the Nigerian player in January 2017 for just over €17 million from KRC Genk.
