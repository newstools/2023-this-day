Emma Okonji An immigrant recruitment portal for professionals has been launched in Nigeria for immigrant job seekers in Canada, Europe and America. The portal was unveiled at a virtual event that was held recently and attended by resettlement experts, Information technology experts, human resources experts and international development experts.  Speaking at the launch, the Founder of the www.iquolify.com Project, Akin Fadeyi, said: “iQuolify is a well thought out digital recruitment solution for immigrant professionals who compromise their qualifications for jobs below their pay grade outside their countries. iQuolify will focus on showcasing immigrants to prospective employers, data analytics for policy makers, mentoring and training until target immigrants are able to optimally integrate and unlock their potentials.” MacArthur On-Nigeria Director, Dr. Kole Shettima, said the Foundation had always held diversity, equity and inclusion as values, adding that at the MacArthur Foundation, we ensure that our decisions and actions are rooted in the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion by embracing the unique attributes of all individuals, creating a fair playing field for all and cultivating environments where everyone feels respected, valued, and a sense of belonging. “iQuolify is therefore a very compelling fit into our work culture, and I commend the initiative,” Shettima said. Co-Founder for the Canadian iQuolify, Dr. Bankole Odole, said: “As an immigrant with five Masters Degrees, I have experienced the challenges that immigrant professionals grapple with. The idea of iQuolify is therefore a ready solution capable of shielding other incoming immigrants from such same challenges.
