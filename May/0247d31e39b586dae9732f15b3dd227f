The management of generally acclaimed “Africa’s Funniest Man Alive”, Francis Agoda, better known as I Go Dye, has stated that the comedian is currently at the last lap of his European tour tagged “I Go Dye Standing Tall”. The tour, which was organized by Motherland Venture, Switzerland and Seaside Entertainment Company, kicked off in Zurich on April 30, 2023 and has since berthed in other cities across Europeincluding Germany, Italy, Austria, before the crowning stage in Amsterdam, Holland. The “I Go Dye Standing Tall” tour has since become a must-attend event in all the cities it has been staged. The Duisburg show, Getmany was particularly iconic as the comedian during his performance gifted all the proceeds from fans to a German guest who was celebrating her birthday that night. This gesture surely endeared fans to I Go Dye who has over time showed how spontaneous he can be on the stage. A near repeat of the Germany episode re-occurred in Graz, Austria, where a teenage boy who had gone to spray I Go Dye money in appreciation for his delivery, got the shock of his life when the comedian gave him every single currency he had been gifted at the event earlier to the young boy. The Global Tour which will end on the 3rd of June will see the multiple-award-winning comedian perform at Amsterdam with a promise to reschedule a new date for his fans in Turkey. “I Go Dye is expected back in Nigeria in the middle of June to meet up with other engagements before getting out for the second leg of his globa tour in the United Kingdom in August, Canada (September) and the United States of America in October,” the management affirms. The management also added that he will be touring three additional cities in Europe before the UK, Canada and US tours.
