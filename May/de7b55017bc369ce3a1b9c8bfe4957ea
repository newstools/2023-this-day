Providing an insight into the relationship between the two institutions, the President, CIS, Mr. Oluwole Adeosun, explained that both institutions were not only established about the same time but shared some common mandates  to train future leaders. CIS, being a certification institute also is involved in top-notch training programmes. “We were both established at about the same time: LBS in 1991 and CIS charters in 1992. We both share a common mandate to train and produce professional leaders for the Nigerian economy, and we have both acquitted ourselves remarkably well in this regard, setting the pace and standards in our various jurisdictions. The partnership is expected to provide a good platform for industry professionals and executives to catch up with the rapidly changing business landscape and innovations in the contemporary business environment, “Adeosun said. Explaining further, he said the programme was of immense significance to the economic development of Nigeria as one giant step in upgrading professional competence.
