Birthdays are not occasions meant only for celebrations, where glasses filled with vintage drinks are clinked and sumptuous delicacies munched. They are also occasions for introspection and expression of gratitude to God for the grace to still be counted among the living. This definitely will be the case for the brilliant and world-class Architect, Princess  Ejindu, otherwise known as Fifi Ejindu, as she clocks 61 today, May 21, 2023. Today, the astonishingly beautiful woman who sits atop many conglomerates will have more than one reason to be joyous, apart from the grace to survive the mysteries of the days and nights in the past year. When she rises from her ornate bed to witness the dawn of the new beautiful day, her heart will be filled with gratitude to God for the grace to mark another birthday in sound health. Reliable sources disclosed that the birthday celebrations would definitely be low-key.  Family members, friends, business associates, fans and admirers are expected to pour encomiums on her on a momentous day in the life of the successful architect and businesswoman who is also a style and fashion icon and the great-granddaughter of King James Ekpo Bassey of Cobham Town in Calabar, Cross Rivers State. A successful entrepreneur, Ejindu has a charm that is irresistible and is noticed the moment she enters a room. She does this so effortlessly but one cannot expect anything less from a woman whose meaning of her first name is  ‘Full moon’. She is as generous, collaborative, and lovable as she is innovative and brilliant, helping those who are in need. Her heart of gold stems from her innate belief that behind every success story are others helping to make it happen.
