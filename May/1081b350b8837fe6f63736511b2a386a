According to a statement by the bank, on Friday, in Osogbo, Adewole, and the newly-deployed police boss also brainstormed on how the two entities can work together to improve the security situation in the zone. “Adewole and the AIG discussed possible areas of collaboration to improve the overall security situation in the zone.
