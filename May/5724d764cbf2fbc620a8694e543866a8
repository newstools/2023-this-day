Out of the thousands who auditioned for a spot in the eighth season of Nigerian Idol, only 10 contestants will participate in the live show which will begin tonight. The 10 contestants were adjudged best performers by the trio of Obi Asika, D’banj, and Simi after five weeks of audition and theatre week performances. The eighth season’s top 10 contestants are Savvy Henry, Constance, Goodness, Abraham, Quest, Precious Mac, Victory, Reigny, Ose Daniel, and Chisom. Performances on the live show will be judged by the viewers who hold the power to retain and evict contestants through their votes.
