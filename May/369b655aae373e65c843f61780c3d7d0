Sumaina Kasim in Abuja A Dubai-based Nigerian and former employee of Tigers Properties LLC Dubai, Abimbola Olupaiye yesterday narrated how he had been unjustly accused of fraud and the sordid effects thereafter.  Olupaiye narrated his ordeal at a session with Journalists in Abuja yesterday, expressing shock and disbelief how recent publications by certain online media platforms presented him in bad light.  Recall that recently certain online media outlets had alleged that a Nigerian man had been fingered as being involved in multiple cases of land fraud in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. They also alleged that he was currently being prosecuted for obtaining money by fraudulent misrepresentation.  They alleged further that some of those defrauded who are also Nigerians have petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Responding to the allegations yesterday, Olupaiye debunked such information, saying he was not caught in any fraudulent activity and that the EFCC was never after him, or prosecuted him at any time.  While calling for justice, Olupaiye described the allegations as “not only malicious but defamatory. It is pertinent to note that I was never ever served by EFCC, nor any other anti-graft agency, in Nigeria or anywhere in the world.  “The allegations published against me are not only baseless but also have no empirical evidence to back them up. These allegations were purported to cause significant damage to the good reputation I have built over the years.” He, furthermore, explained that the allegations have since had a negative toll on his image, however, demanding an immediate retraction of the allegations and a public apology from the said paddlers, within 48 hours or face legal actions.
