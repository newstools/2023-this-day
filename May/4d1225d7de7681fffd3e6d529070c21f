Super Eagles striker Cyriel Dessers is set to miss Cremonese’s crucial Serie A clash at Juventus on Sunday. Dessers has been an important part of Cremonese’s campaign in Serie A, scoring six goals in the league. He is only behind Daniel Ciofani and compatriot David Okereke on Cremonese’s goalscorers’ chart. Unfortunately, he has missed the Grigiorossi’s previous two games against Spezia and AC Milan. Ahead of the club’s trip to Turin to take on Juventus, Fanta Calcio reports that Dessers is yet to return to full fitness. He has started personalised training, but he is yet to join the full training sessions. Cremonese are in a difficult situation, as they could get relegated from the Serie A if they fail to win their next two games. Asides from Juventus, they play Lazio, Bologna, and Salernitana.
