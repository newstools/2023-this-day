According to the World Bank’s Migration and Development Brief report, remittance flow to Nigeria grew by an estimated 8.85 per cent in 2022 from $19.2 billion in 2021. Africa’s biggest economy saw its diaspora remittances plunge to $17.2 billion in 2020 amid the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic from $25.3 billion in the previous year. “Nigeria witnessed a sharp recovery in flows during 2021 (13.2 per cent), maintaining the improved momentum of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022,” the report said. It however stated that the remittance growth fell in Q2 to 0.5 per cent, compared to the same period in 2021. “Moreover, the country is reaping little benefit from the surge in crude oil prices, while the expatriate community faces real income losses in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Euro Area,” the report further said. The World Bank said remittances flow to sub-Saharan Africa grew an estimated 5.2 percent to $53 billion in 2022, with Nigeria being the largest recipient.
