Udora Orizu  in Abuja Spokesman of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Hon. Ikenga Ugochinyere, and 62 members-elect from the opposition parties, have endorsed the All Progressive Congress (APC) consensus candidates, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas and Hon. Benjamin Kalu, for Speaker, Deputy Speaker of the 10th National Assembly. Ugochinyere, who’s the member-elect representing Ideato North South Federal Constituency, made this known at a live press conference in Abuja, yesterday. He called on other candidates in the race who were banking on opposition votes to stage a rebellion against the Tajudeen Abbas/Benjamin Kalu ticket to withdraw from the race as the opposition votes they were banking on would no longer be available for them. While describing Abass and Kalu as men of integrity, and competence to preside over the affairs of the 10th House of Representatives, Ugochinyere said it was time for national development, growth and stability and not the time for party politics. He called on the APC not to do anything that would tarnish the character of Abbas and Kalu or the independence of the House if the duo emerged victorious. The CUPP spokesman stated that controversy that the House Rules were tampered with were not true, but that the House Rules were last printed in December 2020 and not after the 2023 election and by the Rules, the election would be by open ballot system.
