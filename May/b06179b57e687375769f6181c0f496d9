Supernovas, an in-Drive’s global non-profit initiative, is set to engage children in sports by recruiting coaches who can help them build skills, confidence, and love for the game.   According to the management of in-Drive, the company responsible for financing the project, the decision to engage children in football is driven by the need to help them develop both physically and socially.  Head of Supernovas, Anna Fedorchuk, while sharing insight on the project, explained that the role of coaches was crucial to the overall development of children in sports in Nigeria.  ”We’re looking for people who love children and football and would like to train kids several times a week. For our project, the coach is a key figure, someone who can create a comfortable, safe and friendly environment, inspire a love of football in children, and work with them for the good of the community. Fun, safety, and the children’s comfort come first for us, rather than winning”, Fedorchuk said.  Speaking on the modalities, he said coaches selected for the initiative would be trained by an established expert, ICOACH KIDS- who is skilled in training grassroots sports coaches through methodological recommendations and introduction of courses for the participants.  He further stated that the coaches would be paid depending on the number of groups they train and the time spent. He said the initiative is open to children outside Lagos as this has been created to give more children greater access to these opportunities.  He said the choice of football for the initiative is to attract as much interest from parents, saying that in the future, other sports will be included.   “Interested coaches can register on the Supernovas website between May 5 and June 5. Children between the ages of 5 to 12 years old are eligible to participate,” concludes the statement by Fedorchuck.
