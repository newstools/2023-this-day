The French expression, “La vie en rose” directly translates as “life in pink.” However, the expression essentially represents the determination to have a positive outlook on life, seeing life through rose-coloured glasses. Considering the difficulties of life, this is not an easy outlook. But people like Oba Saheed Elegushi and his wife, Olori Sekinat Aramide have no problem living like this because they have each other. Thus, with the royal couple celebrating their 20th anniversary, people have only good things to say about them. Oba Elegushi, Kusenla III, has never minced words regarding how lucky he considers himself to be the husband of Sekinat. The monarch admitted that the road may not have been very smooth, but he has had it easy with her by his side. Supporting him through thick and thin, she has demonstrated her role in his life as partner and confidante, someone he can always count on. Indeed, it is obvious to all and sundry that the Elegushi pair are a match made in Heaven. In the same way that Sekinat has stood out for her king on many occasions, Elegushi has done the same. For example, there was a rumour recently making the rounds about Sekinat. It was alleged that she had gone to Brazil for a butt-lift surgery, a procedure that reportedly threw her between the lines of life and death. However, Elegushi was quick to come to Sekinat’s defense. He responded to the allegations by affirming her health and depriving rumour mongers of material for their dirty trade. In many ways, Oba Elegushi has shown that before Sekinat is a queen, she is first his wife, someone he chose to love and care for all his life. The queen is no less reserved in her devotion to her husband. Thus, their 20-year marriage is unmatched and enviable to many.
