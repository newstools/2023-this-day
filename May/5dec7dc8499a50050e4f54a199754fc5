HighLife  If there is one thing that always distinguishes the ancient African monarchs from their European counterparts, it is that the former were unreserved and always acted according to their hearts. This translated to different things to different people: some, an increasingly growing kingdom; others, an increasingly growing harem. The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has chosen sides and has thrown his weight behind building a brilliant harem. According to the most recent reports, the monarch has decided on another wife, bringing the size of his harem to a total of seven. Moreover, with seven Oloris, the people are sure to have lots of models to prime their lives after, whereas outsiders would have lots of things to talk about. From the goings-on in the royal palace of the Ooni, the new wife is Dr. Opeoluwa Akinmuda. Thus, with her brilliance as the new cap for the monarch’s harem, the other wives of the king look even more stately, aristocratic, true queens of a true king. The palace of the king has attempted to explain that Akinmuda is not exactly the new wife of Oba Ogunwusi. Instead, it is reported that the monarch married her in 2022 after his 5th wife. However, people were not unaware. The only reason the news of her presence in the monarch’s palace broke is that there are preparations to have a thanksgiving service for their matrimonial union. The monarch married all six of them between September and October of last year. First was Mariam Anako, then Akinmuda, then Tobi Phillips, then Ashley Adegoke, then Ronke Ademiluyi, and finally, Asake Adesegun.
