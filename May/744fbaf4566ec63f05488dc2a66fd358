As an emerging technology, Artificial Intelligence or AI has been increasingly integrated into the newsroom in recent years, changing the way journalists work and creating new opportunities for news organisations to deliver information to their audiences, writes Nosa Alekhuogie One of the most significant ways that AI is being used in the newsroom is for content creation. AI writing tools, such as GPT-3, can generate human-like text based on prompts provided by the user. This can be useful for news organisations that need to create large volumes of content quickly, such as breaking news alerts or financial reports. Additionally, some news organisations have used AI-powered tools like Heliograf, developed by The Washington Post, to automatically generate news stories based on data. AI is used to help journalists with tasks such as fact-checking and analysing large volumes of data. For example, the New York Times has used an AI tool called Kepler to help identify patterns and trends in their vast archives of photos and video. Other news organisations have used AI-powered tools like Veracity.ai to help with fact-checking and detecting misinformation. AI can be used to personalise content for different audiences and optimise content for search engines. News organisations can use AI-powered tools like Atomic Reach to analyse audience data and create content that resonates with specific groups of people. Additionally, it is used to identify the most effective keywords and phrases to use in headlines and stories to improve their visibility on search engines. Concerns about AI In spite of the effective use of AI in the newsroom, there are also concerns about the use of AI in the newsroom. One concern is the potential for bias. AI tools can be biased if they are trained on data that is biased, which could lead to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes or misinformation. Additionally, some critics argue that the use of AI in the newsroom could lead to the replacement of human journalists and a decrease in critical thinking and journalistic judgment. Despite these concerns, the use of AI in the newsroom is likely to continue to grow as technology continues to advance. While AI can be a powerful tool for improving efficiency and delivering information to audiences, it is important for news organisations to approach it with a critical eye and ensure that it is being used in a responsible and ethical manner.

Coming down to Nigeria, AI writing tools are becoming more widely used in newsrooms. Some Nigerian news organisations have already started to experiment with AI writing tools to help with tasks such as content creation, editing, and fact-checking.

Overall, AI writing tools offer significant benefits for journalists, helping them to produce high-quality content more efficiently and effectively. While there may be some concerns around the impact of AI on the journalism industry, these tools have the potential to improve the quality and speed of journalistic output, while also helping journalists to adapt to a rapidly changing media landscape. While AI writing tools have many benefits for journalists, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. Disadvantages There are however, some disadvantages of using AI writing tools in journalism. For instance, AI writing tools may not be able to understand the nuances of language and context in the same way that human journalists can. This means that they may not be able to capture the full meaning of a story or convey the appropriate tone. Again, AI writing tools can be biased if they are trained on data that is biased. For example, if a tool is trained on a dataset that contains biased language or perspectives, it may reproduce that bias in its writing. While AI writing tools can be helpful for generating basic content, they may not have the same level of creativity as human journalists. This means that they may not be able to produce original ideas or angles for stories. There is a risk that journalists may become over-reliant on AI writing tools and start to rely on them too heavily. This could lead to a decrease in critical thinking and journalistic judgment. Then of course some AI writing tools can be expensive, which could make them inaccessible for smaller news organisations with limited budgets. It is therefore important to remember that while AI writing tools can be helpful, they should not replace the skills and expertise of human journalists. Journalists should approach AI tools with a critical eye and use them as a supplement to their own skills and knowledge.
