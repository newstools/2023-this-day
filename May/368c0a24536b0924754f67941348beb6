Folalumi Alaran in Abuja The Assistant Corps Commander Imrana Ibrahim Lamba, unit commander of the Central Business District in Abuja, has called on truck drivers to prioritize safety on the roads following recent accidents and fatalities involving these vehicles. Lamba made the call on Wednesday in Abuja at the safety sensitization campaign with heavy duty truck drivers and safety road show in collaboration with special marshals unit 12 presidency at the old tipper garage Katampe. The campaign aims to raise awareness and educate drivers about various aspects of road safety. Lamba stressed the importance of vigilance, responsibility, and compliance with road safety regulations while operating heavy-duty trucks. He emphasized several key areas for improvement, including proper driving behavior, correct loading of goods and passengers, and regular vehicle maintenance. The campaign also addresses issues such as inadequate lighting, excessive smoking, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The approach of the campaign involves a two-fold strategy. The first focus is on education, with an emphasis on enlightening the drivers about safe practices and regulations. This is followed by the enforcement of traffic rules and regulations. Drivers found lacking proper licensing or engaging in reckless and dangerous driving will face enforcement actions, which may include fines, vehicle impoundment, and temporary detention for enlightenment purposes. While enforcement measures are in place, the campaign recognizes that enforcement alone is not sufficient. The ultimate goal is to appeal to the drivers’ conscience, mind, and spirit so that they understand the importance of refraining from risky behavior rather than facing penalties or enforcement actions. The campaign covers various areas of sensitization, including obedience to traffic lights, use of pedestrian bridges instead of crossing expressways, avoiding driving under stress, and adhering to regulations such as the proper use of zebra crossings, avoiding overloading, possessing a valid driver’s license, wearing seat belts, and ensuring child safety. Through these efforts, the campaign aims to promote responsible and safe driving practices among articulated vehicle drivers, with the overarching goal of reducing accidents and saving lives.
