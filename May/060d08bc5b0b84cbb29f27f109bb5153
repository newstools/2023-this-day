Gbenga Sodeinde in Ado Ekiti The peace in Ado Ekiti,Ekiti State capital was threatened  yesterday  when men of the Amotekun Corp and the Hausa Community engaged in a shoot-out. Trouble began around 9.00am  when some men of the corp swooped on Atikankan Community notoriously known to harbour criminals for many years ordering them to leave the area to a place already provided by government. Just as it used to be in the past when security operatives have tried to no avail to rid the area of criminal elements, they resisted yet again, and this time it turned out to be a major crisis. It was gathered that  many persons were  injured in the gun battle that lasted several hours as traders close to the market and Shop owners closed down abruptly and scampered to safety. Men of the Rapid Response Squad of the Nigerian Police, however, intervened before the situation could degenerate.  The Serikin Hausa,Abdul Yusuf said  he  escaped death by a whisker, saying the situation could have been avoided if the Hausas had obeyed earlier instruction by government. He, however, pointed accusing fingers to a Chief whom they said  seems to be benefiting from the continued presence of the Northerners in the area, while playing the ‘peace card’ inpublic. The Chairman of Ado Local Government, Bosun Oshaloni said he was interfacing with the Hausa community and security personnel to ensure that  peace was  restored. He insisted  that Atikankan had become the base for drug abuse, robbery, and all sort of criminal activities. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sunday Abutu, who promised to get back to the journalists on the matter  did not do so as at time of filling the report.
