Manchester United secured Champions League football for next season with a 4-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford. Casemiro headed the hosts in front, with Anthony Martial sweeping in Jadon Sancho’s pass from close range to double their advantage. Bruno Fernandes added United’s third from the penalty spot after being fouled by Wesley Fofana. And another Fofana error saw Marcus Rashford score a fourth before Joao Felix’s late consolation for the Blues.
