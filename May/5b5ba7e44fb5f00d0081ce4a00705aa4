I have always been passionate about technology, and my love for computing and tech started early in my school days. I was always intrigued by how computers worked and how they could be used to solve problems in the real world. I remember spending countless hours tinkering with any old computer and learning how to reassemble it in my free time. This led me to pursue a degree in computing, and I have been passionate about technology ever since. AI is in the spotlight at the moment, and there are a few opinions that Nigeria is lagging in machine learning. Do you share similar thoughts? Nigeria, like many other countries, is still in the early stages of adopting and implementing AI technologies. While there have been some notable initiatives and progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are still many challenges and barriers that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the lack of technical expertise and infrastructure to support AI development. There is a shortage of skilled data scientists and AI engineers, and many organisations in Nigeria may lack the necessary computing power and data storage capabilities to implement AI technologies effectively. Additionally, there is a need for more investment and support from the government and private sector to drive AI development in Nigeria. While there have been some initiatives such as the establishment of the AI Centre of Excellence by the Nigerian government, more needs to be done to support AI research and development in the country. Despite these challenges, there are also many opportunities for AI development in Nigeria. With a large and growing population, there is a significant potential market for AI-powered products and services. Additionally, there is a wealth of data in various sectors such as finance, healthcare, and agriculture that can be leveraged to develop AI applications that can benefit society. Conclusively, while Nigeria may still be in the early stages of adopting and implementing AI technologies, there are opportunities for growth and development. With the right investments in infrastructure and human capital, Nigeria can catch up with the rest of the world in AI development and contribute to the global AI ecosystem. How does one address the issue of ethics, compassion, and other moral values in artificial intelligence? Addressing ethics, compassion, and other moral values in artificial intelligence (AI) is essential to ensure that AI is developed and used in ways that are fair, just, and beneficial to all. This issue does require a multi-faceted approach that involves developers, users, and stakeholders working together to ensure that AI is developed and used in ways that are consistent with ethical principles and that promote the well-being of all. There have been concerns about AI entrenching systemic racism with its algorithms. Is there a one-way approach to address this?   Thank you for that question. The issue of AI entrenching systemic racism is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a comprehensive approach to address. There is no one-way approach that can fully solve this problem, it requires a holistic and intersectional approach that involves various stakeholders, including policymakers, technology companies, data scientists, and civil society organisations. Given the recent reports on how ChatGPT, the latest generative artificial intelligence can promote cheating among students, will banning it be the right solution? According to a research paper published by BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT “Schools are unprepared for the impact of ChatGPT on teaching and learning, but rather than banning AI they need support to harness its potential” Banning ChatGPT solely based on its potential use for cheating would not be the right solution. It is important to recognise that ChatGPT or any AI tool can be used for both positive and negative purposes. Instead of banning ChatGPT, it will be more effective to focus on addressing the underlying issue of cheating and promoting academic integrity. This can be achieved through a combination of educational, technological, and inclusive enforcement strategies. With tech companies carrying out widespread layoffs, what is the impact on a country like Nigeria, where the tech industry appears to be flourishing? I will look at this from a two-way approach. First, the impact of tech companies’ massive layoffs on a country like Nigeria where tech is booming can be complex and multifaceted. Layoffs can lead to a reduction in the number of available jobs in the tech industry, which can be challenging for those who are looking for work in the sector. This can also result in a slowdown in the growth of the tech industry as a whole, as companies may be less likely to invest in new projects or expand their operations. On the one hand, layoffs can also create opportunities for new businesses and entrepreneurs to emerge. For example, if a large tech company lays off a significant number of employees, some of those individuals may decide to start their own businesses or join smaller startups. This process can lead to the development of new products and services, as well as the growth of the local tech ecosystem. Overall, the impact of tech companies’ layoffs on a country like Nigeria will depend on a range of factors, including the size and scope of the layoffs, the specific companies and industries affected, and the broader economic conditions in the country. However, it’s worth noting that the tech industry in Nigeria has been growing rapidly in recent years, and there are many opportunities for innovation and growth in the sector, even in the face of challenges such as layoffs. Why was it important for you to set up CDD Tech Academy? The establishment of CDDtech Academy was motivated by two key important reasons.
