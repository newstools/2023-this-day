Political might is not one of those things that are measured in years, the loudness of the politician’s voice, or the sheer limitlessness of boasting capabilities. There is always more to this type of might, a reality that many politicians are only now finding out. For aspiring Senate Presidents Godswill Akpabio and Orji Uzor Kalu, the difference in the prospects of success cannot be clearer. And even though nothing is certain in politics until the person is almost out of office, it is now obvious that Akpabio stands a better chance at being Senate President compared to Kalu. Considering that Akpabio and Kalu do not see eye to eye on the direction that things are going, one can only come to certain conclusions. First, as Akpabio is the person that power brokers appear to be favouring, one can conclude that he is a better diplomat than Kalu. It was not long ago that it was reported that the socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, stood against the opinions of Kalu as the latter had opposed the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to have the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives—not the Senate President—come from the South-east. On the other side of the bench, more individuals are getting behind Akpabio and even begging those opposing his bid to back down and let him be the Senate President. With Akpabio boasting some 76 senatorial supporters, the difference between him and Kalu cannot be more stark. Seeing as things are the way they are, what is Kalu supposed to do—take lessons on political influence and might from Akpabio?
