She welcomed the dialogue and implored communication professionals to proffer solutions on how Africa’s stories can be best told.Speaking at the event, Oluwarantimi Olaniyan, the Business Lead of Quadrant MSL, stressed the importance of getting Africa’s story right. She said, Africa’s development is dependent on the perception of its activities by both dwellers and continental colleagues.“This perception of Africa determines the volume and degree of trade and investment, patriotism, and hope. For this reason, the African story must be apt to deliver the positive outcomes Africans desire. We must look beyond ourselves to collaborate across sectoral and specialisation borders in order to enhance the true story of our diversity, bringing in content creators, media and non-communicators into the mix.” Oluwarantimi who is quite keen about responsible communications reiterated that what communicators say and how they say it, have an impact on Africa’s reputation.Panellists, Okiti and Osage-Brown, agreed that the African story was about its diversity and uniqueness, stressing the roles that internal competence and history play in the collective narrative.Sharing their excitement about the dialogue, attendees referred to the event as perhaps the most impactful dialogue on responsible communications, in recent years.On why Africa Communications Week is important, ACW host in Lagos, Victoria Uwadoka disclosed that dialogues like ‘Telling the Africa Story’ are instrumental in shaping and amplifying the dynamic narratives of Africa. She said, “As African communicators, we have a responsibility to represent and reflect the realities, challenges, and opportunities of our continent. As we engage, it is my hope that we all embrace our responsibility as communicators and make a positive impact on Africa’s narrative.”Other top public relations practitioners present at the event included CMC Connect Group’s CEO and President, African Public Relations Association (APRA), Yomi Badejo-Okusanya, as well as Assistant General Manager Operations of Channels Television, Kingsley D. Uranta, who encouraged partnerships and sponsorships of amazing African and Nigerian storytelling platforms.
