Nigeria’s t integrated telecommunications solutions company, Globacom, has highlighted focus and persistence as critical success factors for girls who seek to pursue careers in the information and communications technology industry as a way of bridging the wide gender disparity in the industry. The company, which partnered with e-Business Life Communication Limited on this year’s Girls In ICT Day 2023 sensitisation and mentorship workshop for girls and students from select schools across Lagos and Ogun states, enjoined girls who seek a future in the ICT space and sciences in general to keep up the drive for perfection and success. The programme was held at the Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, to mark this year’s edition of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Day for ‘Girls in ICT’, a day set aside to sensitise girls to take up careers in the various fields of Information and Communication Technology. The theme of this year’s event is: ‘Digital Skills For Life’. Globacom, a strong supporter of equal opportunity for all, sponsored the event as a way of encouraging female students to take up the challenge of acquiring the necessary skills in ICT in order to contribute to the growth of the country. Speaking to the girls at the event, Mrs. Adeniji Adeboye, Head of HNI, Enterprise Business Group at Globacom, encouraged them to be focused on their education so as to make a huge impact in an industry that has consistently seen less female representation. She called on school girls not to be discouraged in the pursuit of their dreams as “persistence drives success” in all human endeavours. “Globacom will always encourage you all to embrace the various opportunities existing and those yet to be created in the ICT space and build fulfilling and rewarding careers,” she said.   At least 16 schools were represented at the event, which also had participants engaging in quiz competition, roundtable discussions, presentations, and others.
