Arsenal are desperate to retain the services of youngster, Ethan Nwaneri amid reports that Manchester City are in pole position to sign the 16-year-old in the summer. It has been reported by Football Insider that Arsenal are ready to do all they can to prevent him from leaving the club. Nwaneri became the youngest player in Premier League history aged 15 years and 181 days when he came off the bench to replace Fabio Vieira in Arsenal’s 3-0 road win over Brentford on September, last year. The Anglo-Nigerian midfielder, who turned 16 in March, tallied eight goals in all competitions for Arsenal youth teams this season, including four in the U18 Premier League, two in the U18 Premier League Cup and two in the FA Youth Cup. Due to his exceptional talent, his growth has been fast-tracked and that is why he has featured for the Arsenal first team. However, he is yet to sign a scholarship contract with Arsenal and that explains why he is heavily linked with a move to Manchester City. The Citizens have identified Nwaneri as a player who can fortify their youth sides and go on to establish himself as a first-team player. Should Arsenal lose Nwaneri,  they would only be entitled to a compensation package for his training and education as he is yet to pen his first professional contract. The Flying Eagles-eligible midfielder has also been linked with Chelsea.
