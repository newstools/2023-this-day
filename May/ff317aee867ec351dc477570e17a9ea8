Chelsea and Fulham are reportedly keeping tabs on red-hot Nigerian striker Gift Orban who has been in unbelievable form since joining Belgian side, KAA Gent in the January transfer window. As previously reported, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur were among the clubs that posted scouts to run the rule over the striker during Gent’s league match with Cercle Brugge on Saturday, May 13. According to Evening Standard, Chelsea and Fulham are also watching the talented center forward. The 20-year-old has notched  14 goals and two assists in 13 appearances in the Jupiler Pro League and Jupiler Pro League Europe playoffs including a hat-trick against Cercle Brugge last week and a haul against Zulte Waregem in March. Orban has also announced himself in Europe scoring the fastest hat-trick in the history of European club competition against stanbul Baakehir in the second leg of the Round of 16 of the Conference League. He bagged his hat-trick within 3 minutes and 25 seconds which left everyone with their mouths agape. He has tallied 19 goals in 19 games for Gent which is an average of a goal per game and it is unsurprising that he has attracted the interest of a host of suitors. Orban joined Gent in the January transfer window and it will take a hefty fee to price him away from the Buffalos.
