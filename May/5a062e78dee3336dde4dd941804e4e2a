He said: “I cannot step down for anybody. I’m contesting the Senate Presidency but we are talking with Senators-elect Abdulaziz Yari on the possibility of a joint ticket and talks has reached an advanced stage on the issue. “Our group and his group are talking and we are in intimate partnership and talks are ongoing.

We have not decided on who will be Senate President and who will be deputy.” On the issue of the Niger Delta Ministry, Kalu said: “Some of the ministries and federal agencies are no longer viable. An example is the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs “The Niger Delta Development Commission and the North East Development Commission can be reporting directly to the Presidency.  “The Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs should be scrapped and NDDC should be repositioned.”
