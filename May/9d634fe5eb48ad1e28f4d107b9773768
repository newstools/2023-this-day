In recognition of his fast track of the approval processes leading to the operationalization of Nigeria’s first deep seaport, unprecedented revenue generation and remittances to consolidated revenue fund, port infrastructure renewal, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, has been awarded the 2022 maritime icon of the year by Champion Newspapers.  Bello-Koko was also applauded for his milestone steps towards the deployment of the Port Community System (PCS) to lay the groundwork for the National Single Window that is necessary to tackle the challenge of duplicity of functions and attendant delays in the Ports and facilitation of the renewed export orientation of the federal government and efforts towards increased utilization of ports in the eastern region. The award organisers also praised Bello-Koko for injecting fresh impetus into the authority and trajectory as an agency of first choice that contributed immensely to the economic and social development of the country through increased revenue generation.  According to the Group Managing Director, Champion Newspapers, Dr Nwadiuto Iheakanwa, Bello-Koko’s ingenuity has made the nation’s seaports surmount some of the known challenges that have made the nation’s ports largely inefficient over the years.  “On all scores, our findings, largely corroborated by that of independent assessors, confirm that NPA under your management in the last four years has received fresh impetus due largely from your exemplary leadership skills, sustained its solid tradition of excellence and trajectory as an agency of first choice and agency that has made the country proud and contributed immensely to its economic and social development. “Your ingenious, creative, pragmatic and resilient approach to leadership has brought a lot of transformation to the NPA which has continued to surmount some of the known challenges that have made the nation’s ports largely inefficient over the years.
