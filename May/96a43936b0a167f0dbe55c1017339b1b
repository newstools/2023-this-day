A rare gem and a huge treasure to Nigeria, especially in the area of security, intelligence and political stability of our dear country. “When I met him, he took time to ask me critical questions about Nigeria and my understanding of the system. On providing my answers, he made some few recommendations but concluded that ‘I think you have the best solution to most of the problems of this country amongst most people I met in my life. I am impressed! I encourage you to keep pushing and never stop pushing.’ “He also advise that I should be pragmatic in my political life. “I thanked him very much. I promised to keep pushing, never to give up and become more pragmatic. And frankly, his advise works on me. “I’m indeed very grateful, General.
