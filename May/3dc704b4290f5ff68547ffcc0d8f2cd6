Rebecca Ejifoma The Commandant of the Nigerian Army School of Signals, Maj-Gen Nosakhare Ugbo, has said the ongoing cognitive skills conference would equip military personnel with the necessary tools to enhance their proficiency in operations within and outside the country.  He remarked on this while fielding questions from journalists at the opening of the three-day Leadership workshop of the Nigerian Army School of Finance and Administration in Lagos.  “What we are doing today is training leaders that will aid troops in combat. Every leader has a role to play in addressing challenges.  “The leaders should be capable of taking through and very thoroughly to arrive at decisions that will impact positively on the outcome of the actions we take in combat,” the commandant and keynote speaker emphasised.  According to Ugbo, once this crop of officers is trained and deployed, there would be positive impacts on all its operations within and outside the country.  Speaking on the theme, “The Importance of Cognitive Skills in Leadership within a Complex Environment,” the commandant underscored the duty of leaders.  In his words, “The duty of the leader is to read the situation and ensure that based on the circumstances on ground, and the resources he has, he can deal decisively with whatever is before him.” The Maj-Gen also argued that once the thinking ability and cognitive skills of the personnel are accelerated, they can appreciate the generality of the situation in the fields and arrive at a significant decision.  On his part, the Chief Host and Commandant Nigerian Army School of Finance and Administration, Brig-Gen Julius Osifo, noted that the ongoing training aims to augment the cognitive skills of the 50 participants for optimal performance.  He also encouraged the personnel to take advantage of the leadership seminar for maximum development.
