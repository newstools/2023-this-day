Mary Nnah Aid for Rural Education Access Initiative (AREAi) has recently launched a partnership with the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) under the leadership of the Honorable Federal Commissioner, Hajiya Imaam Sulieman-Ibrahim Fsi. Led by its Executive Director, Prince Gideon Olanrewaju, AREAi would drive the facilitation and access to accelerated and informal educational opportunities for IDP, refugee, and migrant children. ‘Project Educate All’ is focused on addressing the foundational needs that bridge the educational gaps of children amongst persons of concern (PoCs), and the marginalized communities in Nigeria. This pilot is being implemented across eight IDP camps namely: New Kuchingoro, Takuchara, Karamajiji, Wassa, Waru, New Karshi, Malaysian Garden, and Yimutu, which have over 800 children, ages 5 to 18 enrolled already. These children will be equipped with relevant skills across four different pathways, namely: Literacy, Numeracy, 21st Century Life Skills, and the Digital Skills Accelerator (DSA) programme for STEM. This initiative is heavily integrated with globally recognised methodologies and digital technology that allows these children to experience learning at their teaching levels, as well as the ability to learn in their mother tongue for enhanced understanding. In her remarks at the official flag-off/ project launch recently, the Honorable Federal Commissioner succinctly explained that: “This engagement has not only provided the much-needed employment in these communities but also allowed us to prioritise the localisation of our interventions and promote the sustainability of the programme.” She maintained that education remains the bedrock of development, and peaceful coexistence and pointed out that without education for all, the displaced would lead a very harsh life and existence, one that could also lead to severe social and economic consequences for the nation, particularly for the people of concern (PoCs), IDPs, and host communities. Over the year, over 4000 children will continue to learn across four pathways in the eight IDP camps where the implementation is being carried out.
