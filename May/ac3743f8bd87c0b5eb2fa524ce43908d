Folalumi Alaran in Abuja A non-governmental organization (NGO) GreenLight Initiative focused on improving road safety in Nigeria, has urged the Federal Government to implement a 30-kilometer speed limit on Nigerian roads and take measures to promote sustainable transportation systems. The call was made by Mr. Simon Patrick Obi, the Executive Director of the organization, during a courtesy visit to the Assistant Corps Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr. Imrana Lamba Ibrahim, in Abuja. The plea from the GreenLight Initiative is in line with the theme of the 7th United Nations Global Road Safety Week, which highlights the importance of sustainable transport and encourages governments to support walking, cycling, and public transportation. The organization believes that prioritizing human-powered transportation modes like walking, cycling, and public transport will not only minimize road accidents but also promote physical activity, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve public health by reducing air pollution. Mr. Obi emphasized the global significance of the UN Global Road Safety Week and highlighted the alarming statistics of road crashes, stating that over 1.35 million people are killed on the worldâ€™s roads each year. He also acknowledged that road crashes are a leading cause of death for young people between the ages of five and 29, and Nigeria faces its fair share of road safety challenges. The benefits of sustainable transport, as outlined by the GreenLight Initiative, include promoting physical activity, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, decreasing traffic congestion, improving air quality, enhancing public health, and facilitating access to essential services and economic growth through investments in public transport. Assistant Corps Commander Imrana Lamba Ibrahim of the Federal Road Safety Commission expressed his appreciation for the visit and promised further partnership with the GreenLight Initiative. He was also honored with an award of excellence by the organization as part of the UN Global Road Safety Week. The UN Global Road Safety Week is a biennial campaign aimed at raising awareness about road safety and reducing the number of deaths and injuries caused by road crashes worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people aged 5 to 29, and they also result in significant economic losses for countries each year.
