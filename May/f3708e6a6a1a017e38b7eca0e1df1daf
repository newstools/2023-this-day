Rafael Nadal is set to miss the French Open for the first time in his career as he revealed that next year would likely be his last on tour. The French Open has responded after Nadal officially announced his withdrawal. The Spaniard is a record 14-time champion at the tournament but revealed that it would be “impossible” to play through his injury this year. Nadal also confessed that 2024 would likely be his final year on the tour in a press conference on Thursday. Nadal will miss the French Open for the first time since making his debut in 2005. The 36-year-old has an incredible record at the tournament – winning 14 titles and losing just three matches. He has only ever withdrawn part-way through the event once – in 2016 with a wrist injury. But on Thursday Nadal confirmed that he would be absent this year, saying: “I won’t be able to play at Roland Garros. It’s not a decision I made, it’s a decision my body made.” The tournament has now responded in an emotional Instagram post, as they shared their hopes of seeing the 14-time champion make a return next year. “Rafa, We can’t imagine how hard this decision was,” they wrote under a photo of Nadal holding the trophy 11 months ago. “We’ll definitely miss you at this year’s Roland-Garros. Take care of yourself to come back stronger on courts. Hoping to see you next year in Paris.”
