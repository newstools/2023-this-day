Mary Nnah It was a celebration of African rich culture as the Opening Night and Cultural Day event held at the Federal Palace Hotel and Casino, Lagos on Thursday to kick off the series of activities preceding the 9th edition of the Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA) scheduled to hold on Saturday, May 20th in Lagos. Executive Head, Content and West Africa Channels at MultiChoice Nigeria, Dr. Busola Tejumola, said this year’s edition of the AMVCAs is focused on raising the bar when it comes to recognising and rewarding talents in the various aspects of the African film and television industry. “Last year, we had an eight-day lineup of activities leading to the Award Night. This year will be no different. We have decided to sustain the momentum by bringing back all the activities. The only difference is that they will all take place within three days”, she noted.  The Opening Night and Cultural Day event – a celebration of African culture and diversity will be followed by the ‘Runway Show and Nominee Gala’ scheduled for Friday, May 19. In this year’s runway competition, the winners stand the chance to walk away with cash prizes and the opportunity to work with the brand team of Pepsi, one of the brands they are set to create innovative designs for on the runway. The celebration will climax with the award night on Saturday, May 20. The award show will air live on May 20 across all Africa Magic channels on DStv and GOtv, starting from 4 pm WAT with Zozibini Tunzi, the South African model, and IK Osakioduwa, the Nigerian TV star as hosts for the award ceremony.
