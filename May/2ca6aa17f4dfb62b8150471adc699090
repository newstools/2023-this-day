Hammed Shittu in Ilorin Kwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said governors from the north central region of the country under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are not against the position of the national leadership of the party on National Assembly zoning. AbdulRazaq, however said the governors were instead holding strategic meetings with different stakeholders to secure a better deal for the region. In a statement issued in Ilorin, yesterday, signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor stated that, “the governors from the zone have not made any public statement on the zoning formula for parliamentary positions.” AbdulRazaq who denied a media report quoting them as rejecting the position of the party leadership on the issue said that, “the Governors, being party leaders from the region, cannot adopt confrontational posture against the party’s position but are instead holding strategic meetings with different stakeholders to secure a better deal for the north central.” He said, “Media reports that we reject the party’s position are therefore a stretch of our approach. They are not factual. “We have our channels of communication, and that is what we are exploring.” The governor therefore said, “We are party people and will not make any public statement or do anything that will rubbish its leadership or cause avoidable tension in the polity. That is not our way.”
