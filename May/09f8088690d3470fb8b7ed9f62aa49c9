“Those we love don’t go away, they walk beside us every day. Unseen, unheard, but always near; still loved, still missed and very dear,” so says a popular quote. Despite the death of Madam Caroline  Adesola, mother of popular auto magnate and serial entrepreneur, Adebayo Adesola, about three years ago, her memories have remained stuck in the minds of the auto magnate and his siblings. When she died on May 1, 2020, at the age of 71, their hearts were indescribably heavy, but they were quickly comforted by the fact that their dear mother lived a fulfilled life and impacted humanity positively. So, Adesola, the Ondo State-born managing director of Vision Wheel, alongside his siblings, pulled all the stops and gave their septuagenarian mother a befitting burial. She was interred at the Vaults and Gardens, Ikoyi, Lagos at a funeral that was attended by top personalities from all walks of life, home and abroad.  Family sources said Madam Adesola was given everything she dreamt of and so much more by her children even before she was diagnosed with cancer during a summer trip in 2015. The business mogul and his siblings didn’t spare anything to ensure that she underwent intensive treatment till her cancer was in remission. But unfortunately, it resurfaced five years after and she eventually succumbed to it. But since she was taken away by the grim reaper, she has remained in their memories. Recently, her children gathered once again for a memorial prayer for the soul of their loving mother. Society Watch was told that a dinner was also held for family members, close friends as well as business associates that came for the remembrance service.
