Reaffirming its commitment to celebrating the African creative industry, Amstel Malta threw its weight behind the just concluded 9th edition of the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards (AMVCA), held on Saturday, May 20, 2023, at Eko Convention Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. As the headline sponsor, the malt brand sponsored several distinguished categories. The notable winners included Kunle Afolayan, who won the Best Overall Film for Anikulapo; Victor Iyke and Kent Edunjobi respectively won the Best Indigenous Igbo Movie and Best Soundtrack for their performances in Uhuruchi and Anikulapo. Oluwatoyosi Fowode’s ‘Leaked’ won the Multichoice Talent Factory Film, while Beauty Tukura took home the Best Dressed award at the event. It also created moments with Golden Hour, where the guests were treated to an immersive photography journey. At the AMVCA After Party, the malt drink transported guests into a world of pulsating music, dazzling glow in the night lights, and performances from dance troupes during the Amstel After Dark. “Amstel Malta remains committed to championing excellence, inspiring dreams, and providing a platform where African talent shines brightly. Together with the AMVCA, we will continue to empower African creatives and showcase their brilliance to the world,” said Portfolio Manager, Non-alcoholic Brands, Nigerian Breweries, Elohor Olumide-Awe.
