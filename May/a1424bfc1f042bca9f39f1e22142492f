The Northwest Progressives Forum( NPF) has lampooned ex-Presidential aide Mr. Obono-Obla, for what it described as “reckless outburst and attention-seeking rant” against Senator Abdul’Aziz Yari, a frontline APC contender for the slot of Senate President. In a media statement signed by the group’s Director of Public Relations, Adamu Isa on Saturday, the group wondered why the ex-presidential aide “who has case of fraud with the ICPC has the guts to call Yari names and even object the APC Senate President’s legitimate struggle for the number-three seat”. The group, in the statement, recalled that “the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) in late January 2021 arraigned Mr. Obono-Obla, and two others for fraud and certificate forgery.” The Statement stressed that Obono-Obla, as a former Special Assistant to the President on Prosecution and ex-Chairman of the disbanded Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIP), “was arraigned by the ICPC and the matter is not yet over”. The NPF also reacted to the stance of the Forum of National Assembly Legislative Aides from the North West, which reportedly expressed displeasure with the refusal of Yari to back down for Senator Akpabio. “We were not surprised that the Forum of Legislative Aides of the National Assembly would hold a Press Conference to insinuate that Yari’s backing out of the race was the only way forward just because they have a hidden agenda . Truth is, at the end of the day, only Senators elected under the 10th Senate have the power to choose their leaders from amongst themselves. “We’re happy to have read and fully support the position of the ruling party as reflected in the full-page interview of the National Chairman of the APC, His Excellency Abdullahi Adamu, in the Daily Trust, when he said ‘ Senators will elect elect their leaders on D-day”, the NPF Director said in the Statement.
