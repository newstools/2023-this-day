Based on the following, the applicant said it wrote the commission on April 18, 2023, requesting that the EFCC, “prosecute the defendants but that they have failed to do till date.”“That the respondent has failed to act in accordance with its establishment Act as it relates to the prosecution of financial crimes and other related offences in Nigeria. “That the intervention of the court is required to compel the respondent to comply with the clear and unambiguous provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.”They therefore prayed the court for, “An order granting leave to the applicant to apply for judicial review in terms of an order of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with the provisions of Section 7(2) of the EFCC Act, 2004, by way of filing a criminal charge before this court against one Fubara Siminayi, Harrisonba Bessi Princewill, Lekia V.
