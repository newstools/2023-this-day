I would help them push their music, follow them to the studio but i wasn’t moved by the money but my passion kept me going. Later I found an Artiste that gave me my first millions. He paid me 5million for management and promotion which was the beginning of my breakthrough and movement because I now had resources to show how good I am at what I do. But SEYI VIBEZ gave me the best platform for what I have become today as he believed so much in me. I was able to exhibit every good idea I had inside me with him in that short period of time that I worked with him.
