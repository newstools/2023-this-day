I am amazed to see that Prince Harry and Meghan allege there was a near catastrophic paparazzi car chase in New York. Although my experience is limited to a week visit and what I see on TV I doubt that any car could drive at more than 10mph and certainly not for more than two hours. Maybe he lives in a different universe than I do but this seems a bit more of a publicity stunt than a real event. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
