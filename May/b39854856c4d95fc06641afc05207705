Different occupations and preoccupations exist, many for self-satisfaction and many others for the gratification of people other than the labourers in question. Pastor Idowu Iluyomade of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) City of David Parish, Victoria Island, Lagos is one of the labourers. It is people like him and his wife, Siju, that are labouring to see the will of God done in their lives and the land. Recently clocking 63, it is certain that Iluyomade has much to thank God for. Despite being a clergyman in one of the many branches of the church, Iluyomade is well-known across Nigeria. One of the reasons for his popularity is that he is the Special Assistant to the RCCG General Overseer, Pastor E. A. Adeboye, on Christian Social Responsibility via the arm of His Love Foundation. Another reason is that Iluyomade can be held responsible for helping to make the construction of the Trinity Towers a reality in the City of David parish of the RCCG in Oniru Estate, Victoria Island, Lagos. Furthermore, Iluyomade is widely known for his service to God and the church. He and his wife have been married for almost 40 years and have spent a large fraction of this period in the service. As a result, Iluyomade is well-loved and regarded in RCCG and other churches across the globe. According to reports, Iluyomade and his wife, Siju, have gone on a pilgrimage to Israel in celebration of his 63rd birthday. It is also reported that the man in question would rather spend that time in the City of David rather than outside, but he has been ordered to rest a bit before diving back into labour. Ultimately, the man is an inspiring figure. Even at 63, he is strong and getting stronger in service to God.
