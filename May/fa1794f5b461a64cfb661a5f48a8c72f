Emma Okonji Airtel Africa, a provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, has launched a new Africa-wide brand campaign focused on building a deeper emotional connection with young people. The brand campaign is also expected to connect Nigeria’s productive generation of youths. The campaign includes a new strapline for Airtel: ‘A Reason to Imagine’. It is driven by the insight that in Africa, imagination is the only qualification that matters and showcases Airtel Africa’s role in harnessing this potential by delivering relevant solutions to consumers that enhance digital and financial inclusion. The ‘A Reason to Imagine’ campaign highlights the status of Airtel as an enabler of young people’s dreams and ambitions, whatever these might be. To this end, the campaign seeks to celebrate the energy, creativity, and innovation of Nigerian youth. Speaking at the launch in Lagos recently, Airtel Nigeria’s Chief Executive Officer, Carl Cruz, said: “Africa’s young people are now more than ever, owning their passions boldly, chasing their dreams with all their heart, and living life on their terms. At Airtel, we see this growth as a beautiful thing. This is why our new brand purpose represents our commitment to the future. It is about youth, about excitement, about fun, and most of all, about imagination.”
