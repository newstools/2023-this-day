A leading Cloud and Digital solutions provider, inq. Digital Nigeria Limited, has affirmed its dedication to promoting gender equality in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. The company, therefore, called for support to empower girls, enabling them to assume their rightful place in the global ICT ecosystem and contribute to technological advancement. Speaking at the celebration of the 12th edition of International Girls in ICT Day, an initiative organised by eBusiness Life Magazine and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Lagos, the Managing Director of the company, Mr. Valentine Chime, emphasised the importance of fostering partnerships that encourage the acquisition and development of digital skills among youths. He stressed the need to bridge the gender divide, which may widen if the girl-child is not adequately drawn into the realm of information and communications technology (ICT). According to him, “the girl-child must be equipped with digital skills to thrive in the future, as only those who are ICT proficient will succeed. Empowering a girl-child means empowering a nation.” He also underscored the significance of investing in early ICT education, promoting the hiring of women in STEM fields, and challenging socio-cultural beliefs that hinder women’s participation in STEM. The convener of the forum and Publisher of eBusiness Life Magazine, Ufuoma Emuophedaro, highlighted that the global event provides a platform to address the gender digital divide, devise solutions, and foster partnerships that accelerate girls’ involvement in ICT. Closing the gender gap in the ICT sector ultimately contributes to the country’s GDP. She expressed gratitude to inq. Digital for its continuous support of the Girls in ICT initiative and commended the company’s mentorship program, which offers girls firsthand experience in the ICT industry.
