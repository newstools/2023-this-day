By Iyke Bede  Nigerian Afropop singer Leonard Adinya, popularly known as A4 Baba credits legendary musician 2Baba for inspiring his music career. Growing up in Ogoja, A4 Baba’s passion for music blossomed during his time in the church choir. Influenced by 2Baba’s captivating melodies, he found his artistic voice and now stands on the cusp of his musical destiny. “I have listened to him from a tender age and he gives me a lot of inspiration and I’ve grown with that over the years, moulding my artistry and honing my skills,” the singer revealed. “2Baba was one of those we looked up to and he gave us good music for our soul.” With a Masters in Business Administration from Quantic School of Business and Technology, U.S., he stated that his music, over the years, has been targeted towards inspiring people and uplifting souls using his God-given talent. This is fully reflected in his latest track ‘Rain of Blessings’, an upbeat track with gospel/rock elements. Shedding light on his latest projects, Adinya disclosed that he is working closely with Gen Zs to ensure that the younger generation is set on the right path, just as 2Baba’s music did for him. “I’m working on my EP and it’s going to have about five songs, it is something simple. It’s a reincarnation, as I’ve been away for a while. I’m reincarnating and I’m coming up with something new that is in line with this new generation. The Gen Zs are the people taking over the music space in terms of consumption and production, so they are a part of the people working with me on my new project,” A4 Baba concluded.
