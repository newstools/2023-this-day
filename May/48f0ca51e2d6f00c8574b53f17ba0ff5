Super Eagles forward, Emmanuel Dennis, has been ruled out of Nottingham Forest’s squad to face Chelsea today, as the Tricky Tree travel to London hoping to build on their recent triumph against Southampton. In an effort to continue their Monday victory against Southampton, the Tricky Trees will make the trip from West Bridgford to London to take on the Blues. Due to an injury, the former Watford striker Dennis, who could only watch Taiwo Awoniyi and his teammates play at the City Ground, won’t be able to join up with Steve Cooper’s team to face Frank Lampard’s men. According to Forest’s manager, the Nigerian picked up an injury during their training ahead of their 4-3 clash against the Saints, and he is yet to return to the squad. “Dennis has been injured. He picked up a knock in training before Southampton, and he is still not available.” the Welsh manager said in a Nottingham’s pre-match press conference ahead of the Chelsea clash. Since being acquired by Nottingham for $14.80 million in the summer 2022 transfer window, Emmanuel Dennis has lost favour on Cooper’s team. He has only started six of the Reds’ 18 domestic league games this season while scoring two goals and providing two assists. The former Club Brugge attacker was beginning to get his footing after demonstrating his worth during training and producing several opportunities during Nottingham’s build-up plays. But, with three games remaining in the season, the 25-year-old’s injury setback may prevent fans from seeing much of his face on the field.
