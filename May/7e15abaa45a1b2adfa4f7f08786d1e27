The Yoruba Culture Ambassador (Asoju Asa Oodua) to His Imperial Majesty, Ooni of Ife; Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Otunba ‘Dotun Taylor via his non-governmental organization, Roots and Heritage Renaissance Culture Initiative (RHRCI) and Ambassador Alfred Oladotun Taylor Foundation, have donated glasses to the people of Ile-Ife. The empowerment which began with an eye test done on scores of residents of Ile-Ife in Osun State; was to mark the 8th edition of the initiative which is aimed at alleviating the challenges of the people. Themed ‘History is beautiful when you can read it’, the initiative was a laudable event according to project coordinator, Mrs. Bolarinwa Fadamitan who said people need to see to be able to have a future, noted that the initiative was aimed at correcting and assisting people with eyesight problems. In attendance were the aged, young, men, and women of the communities around the Palace of Ooni of Ife, the cradle of the Yoruba kingdom. It was a remarkable gesture of kindness and compassion, especially in a world where many people suffer from visual impairment, and access to medical eye glasses remains a challenge. Ambassador Alfred Oladotun Taylor, the ‘Asoju Asa Oodua’, spoke about how critical eyesight is to people and why he has been supporting people through his generosity gesture. As a Voice of Odua in the House of Oduduwa, he considers it his primary responsibility to give back to the people. “The conduction of eye test and giving of eyeglasses by the Roots and Heritage Renaissance Culture Initiatives was a significant one and an effort to promote proper eye care and attention in the country. It is heartwarming to see how much impact such an initiative can have in bringing hope and improving the quality of life for many people in the community.”
