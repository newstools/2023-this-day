Efforts to make the undisputed heavyweight title fight between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk later this year could restart. But Usyk’s team are currently focused on securing his next fight against another Briton, Daniel Dubois. Dubois is the mandatory challenger for the WBA heavyweight title, one of the three major championships that Usyk holds. The Ukrainian’s promoter Alex Krassyuk told Sky Sports: “We are now concentrated on Dubois as the next step.” But responding to reports that Bob Arum, the co-promoter of WBC heavyweight champion Fury, was in talks to stage the heavyweight championship fight in Saudi Arabia, Krassyuk said: “He is saying that he had talks with Saudi people on Fury vs Usyk. Not us.”
