Efekoha said during his tenure,professionalism, hindsight and foresight will be the watch word in the sub-regional organisation. He thank all members of WAICA and stake holders for the rare opportunity and said that his immediate task would be to ensure proper restructuring and staffing of the Secretariat! work with the West Africa Insurance Supervisors Association(WAISA) to harmonise policies and regulations within the subregion, and make WAICA a repository of information on insurance in West Africa. “To achieve this, the West African Insurance industry need to collectively, and in unity, step up its actions by being the backbone of the various economies, provide the much-required peace of mind for all  stakeholders in these crucial times and create an enabling environment for industries and economies in the sub-region. I promise solemnly that we will work hard to reinvent WAICA for more value addition”, he said.
