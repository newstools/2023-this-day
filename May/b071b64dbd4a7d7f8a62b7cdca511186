By Vanessa Obioha In a night filled with witty remarks, surprising wins and jaw-dropping fashion, ‘Aníkúlápó’ took home the most awards at the ninth edition of the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards (AMVCA), including Best Overall Movie. With the Netflix original produced and directed by Kunle Afolayan, leading this year AMVCA with 16 nominations, it came down to the Best Overall Picture to take the lead over ‘Brotherhood’ which won four awards out of its 11 nominations. Afolayan in his acceptance speech of the Best Overall Movie award acknowledged veteran cinematographer Tunde Kelani for mentoring him in the art and science of filmmaking. ‘Aníkúlápó’ also received the award for Best Sound Editor, Best Writer, Best Soundtrack and Best Indigenous Language Yoruba. Tobi Bakre won the Best Actor for his role in the Jade Osiberu movie ‘Brotherhood.’ It was his first AMVCA and the excited actor could not hide his joy on stage, displaying a gamut of emotions that ranged from surprise, excitement to pride. For the second time, Osas Ighodaro took home the award for Best Actress for her portrayal as the wife of a cleric who has his own demons to battle with in the Bolanle Austen-Peters movie ‘Man of God.’  In a surprising twist, the Ugandan director Loukman Ali edged out prominent Nigerian filmmakers like Kunle Afolayan, Bolanle Austen-Peters and Obi Emelonye to win the Best Director award for his movie ‘Brotherhoods.’ ‘Shanty Town’ which had the most nominations for a TV series, however, took home only one award in the Best Makeup category. Cast members of The Real Housewives of Abuja, Princess Jecoco, Arafa and Tutupie presented the award for the Best Costume Designer and Make Up categories, and as usual Princess Jecoco brought the sauce with her charm. Deola who emerged winner of the Best Costume Designer the winner was too speechless to talk and her husband, the musician Darey Art Alade had to say the acceptance speech they had penned down. In a glorious spectacle, the coveted Industry Merit Award of this year found its rightful place in the hands of the illustrious actress, Patience Ozokwor, affectionately known as Mama G. A surge of admiration swept through the audience, as she received an exhilarating standing ovation. Overwhelmed by the profound significance of the moment, Ozokwor’s heart swelled with emotion, and she found solace in expressing her gratitude to the Most High. In a tender exchange with one passionate supporter who proclaimed their adoration, Patience Ozokwor’s voice rang out, carrying a profound depth of devotion, “You can’t even stop loving me. I will die for your love,” she said. Before leaving the stage, she reassured her fervent admirers that she would remain steadfast in her chosen path, the art of acting, perpetuating the legacy she has so magnificently built throughout her illustrious career. Young actress Angel Unigwe was awarded the Trailblazer award while the Best Dressed Male and Female went to social media influencer Enioluwa Adeoluwa and BBNaija former housemate Beauty Tukura respectively  As with its tradition, tribute was paid to creative talents who have sojourned to the other side. Names like Saint Obi, Ada Ameh among others popped on the screen as Nigerian Idol alumni performed.  There were also musical performances from Tiwa Savage and Iyanya.
