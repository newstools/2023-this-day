Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja A group, South-East Unity Movement, has warned the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against continuous meddling with the leadership affairs of the National Assembly, saying  the legislative arm was constitutionally and democratically independent and autonomous arm of government. In a statement yesterday by its Chairman, Godwish Obi, the group said it was deeply worried by the direction the country was being pushed by power hungry regionalist politicians over the issue of selection of leaders and officers of the 10th National Assembly. It said, “We find it unfortunate that people, who are supposed to be distinguished gentlemen and women trusted with mandates by their constituencies would find it difficult to form leadership for themselves and by themselves without unnecessary interference by vested interests.” It noted that the South-East, in spite of the strident cries of marginalisation in the way the nation was structured and operated, was  still more committed to sustainable peace than all the other sections of the country. According to the group, the South-East would not fold its arms and watch greedy politicians stoke unnecessary regional tensions that would potentially affect  investments all across the country. It, therefore, urged politicians to tread with caution and play by the rules with fairness to all sections of the country devoid of dangerous preconditions and sinister motives. The group also called on political party structures particularly, the party in power to allow the three organs of government to exercise their constitutionally demarcated roles unhindered. “The National Working Committee of the APC is therefore cautioned against continuous meddling with the leadership affairs with the constitutionally and democratically independent and autonomous legislative arm of government,” it stated.
