Tottenham  Hotspur are interested in a move for talented Nigerian forward, Gift Orban, who plays for Belgian outfit Gent. According to UK’s Daily Mail,  the 20-year-old has caught the attention of several top clubs with his impressive performances, having already netted an impressive tally of 19 goals in 19 games across all competitions. Manchester United, Tottenham, and Chelsea have been closely monitoring the young striker’s progress. This level of interest from some of the Premier League’s biggest clubs speaks volumes about Orban’s potential and the impact he has made so far. Gift Orban: “The Premier League is my ultimate dream. Man United, Liverpool or Man City…”.  “I don’t really like Arsenal that much – it’s like they don’t want to win titles”. “I want to go somewhere where they win titles”, Gift Orban told @hlnsport via @Sport_Witness.  With the need to bolster their attacking options becoming increasingly evident, Tottenham Hotspur are among the clubs that are considering making a move for the talented Nigerian sensation. However, it is worth noting that acquiring Orban would likely come with a substantial price tag. Tottenham’s priorities for the transfer window seem to lie elsewhere, with the need to reinforce their defence, secure a quality goalkeeper, and strengthen their central midfield. Considering Orban’s age and the stage of his career, it may be in his best interest to continue his development at Gent, where he is guaranteed regular playing time. Moving to a top club too soon and potentially sitting on the bench could hinder his progress and limit his opportunities to showcase his talent. Additionally, Orban is tied to Gent with a contract that runs until the summer of 2027. This gives the Belgian club the luxury of not being under pressure to cash in on their prized asset just yet. It would be wise for Gent to hold on to the young forward and maximize his potential before considering any potential offers. However, this is not what clubs like Man United or Tottenham would want. Only time will tell what happens with Orban. He seems destined for the very best and let’s hope he reaches that level in the future.
