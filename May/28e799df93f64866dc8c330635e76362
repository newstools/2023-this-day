James Sowole in Abeokuta The Ogun State Police Command has begun a search for a four-man armed robbery gang that escaped with $11 million in Abeokuta, the state capital. Findings revealed that the armed robbers operated successfully Oke Sokori, Abeokuta North Local Government Area without being challenged by security operatives. All adorned on black T-shirts and jean trousers, they wore black face masks, and brandished rifles in the three-minute robbery. They were said to have fled the scene with their targeted money, stacked in two ‘Ghana-Must-Go’ bags, after dispossessing the car of their victim – a Hausa trader – who rode the area in a Toyota Venza salon car. The Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed the report yesterday, describing it as unfortunate. Oyeyemi said: “It is quite unfortunate that the suspects had escaped the scene before our operatives could arrive at the scene. But I want to assure you that we will definitely get them and bring them to justice.” “The command had immediately upon receipt of information about the incident, sent a signal across the state to ensure that the suspects were tracked down. All our technical units have been activated and for sure, we will get them.” “I, however, want to use this medium to assure the good people of Ogun State not to panic as there is no course for alarm; they should remain calm, and go about their normal and routine businesses because our men will surely track down the suspects.”
