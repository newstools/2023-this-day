AC Milan wonderkid, Victor Eletu yesterday landed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on his way to Mendoza to join his Flying Eagles teammates two days before Nigeria’s opening game of the 2023 FIFA U20 World Cup against Dominican Republic. Eletu has been named in Nigeria’s squad list for the World Cup but could not attend the training camp in Abuja and the final round of preparations in Argentina due to club commitments. AC Milan chiefs have finally given him the green light to join his international teammates in Argentina after his impressive performances for the Rossoneri U19s in May. The Prince Kazeem Eletu Academy product was involved in three goals (1 goal, 2 assists) in his last four matches in the Primavera 1. Having departed Milan on Thursday evening, he landed in Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires this morning. As at 1311 hours Nigerian time, Eletu was airborne, on his way to Mendoza to link up with the Flying Eagles. Nigeria U20 head coach, Ladan Bosso has a big call to make, whether to name him in the starting lineup against Dominican Republic or start him on the bench, and it should be noted he’s keeping his cards close to his chest. In preparation for their opener against Dominican Republic, the Flying Eagles held a two-hour recovery session at the Mendoza Technical Center after Wednesday’s arrival in the city.
