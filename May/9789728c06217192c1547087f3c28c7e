Super Falcons and BarcelonaFemeni forward, Aisisat Oshoala, and her team mates, yesterday had their 62-match winning streak halted following their 1-1 scoreline with  Sevilla ladies.   With the league trophy already in the kitty, Femeni appear to be more focussed on the forth coming Women UEFA Champions League final match against Wolfsburg on June 3rd.  Cristina Martin-Prieto gave Sevilla a surprise lead at the Estadio Jesus Navas, and for large parts of the second half, it looked like the home side would hold on for a memorable three points.  Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic scored a late equaliser to rescue Barca’s long unbeaten streak, but their run of victories in the league was brought to an end despite the late introduction of Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas, who is recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury.  Barca last dropped points in Liga F in June 2021, when they were beaten by Atletico Madrid less than 48 hours after winning the Copa de la Reina.  After that defeat, they won the five games remaining in that campaign and all 30 matches’ last season.  Before meeting Sevilla this week, where they fielded a heavily rotated side having already wrapped up their fourth straight Liga F title, they had won all 27 of their league games.
