Laleye Dipo in Minna Niger State Governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello, has confirmed that commander of a security agent has been killed by gunmen in the state. Bello also lamented the escalation of attacks by gunmen in parts of the state, which has now spread to Rijau Local Government Area. However, he did not give the name of the slain commander or the security groups he was heading. Exchanging views with the new Assistant Inspector General of Police Zone 7, Mr. Aliyu Garba, who paid him a courtesy visit at Government House in Minna on Wednesday, Bello said that cases of banditry attacks is reoccurring again in parts of the state, which is becoming disturbing. Hr added that bandits in large number invaded Kumbashi area and engaged security personnel. He, however, said that details of casualty is yet to be known. “One of the commanders of the security agents paid the supreme price,” Bello lamented, adding that “the bandits have moved to Rijau area.” He blamed the new trend on the size of the state and absence of enough boots on the ground. “We don’t have any special forces of police around Rijau area. We have some military personnel but their number is not much considering the wideness of the area coupled with many entry and exit routes in the area,” the governor said. He, therefore, appealed to the AIG to make every effort towards addressing the situation of shortage of manpower in the state’s police command, stressing that the security situation in the state called for very robust and swift action. Earlier, Garba had explained that his visit was to familiarise with the governor and to see how best the police could collaborate with other security agencies in the state in order to address the security challenges facing the state. He restated the importance of government and critical stakeholders support, especially in terms of logistics for effective tackling of crime and criminality in the society.
