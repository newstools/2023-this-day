West Ham United reached their first major European final since 1976 after they overcame AZ Alkmaar in their Europa Conference League semi-final. Having won the the first leg at London Stadium 2-1, the Hammers were resolute away to their Dutch opponents, reaching the final in Prague on 7 June with a 1-0 second-leg win. David Moyes’ side soaked up plenty of pressure at AFAS Stadium until Pablo Fornals scored on the counter-attack in second-half injury time. West Ham will face either Fiorentina or FC Basel, whose semi-final went into extra time. The Hammers are hoping to lift their first major trophy since they lifted the 1980 FA Cup; they were one of three winners of the 1999 Intertoto Cup.
