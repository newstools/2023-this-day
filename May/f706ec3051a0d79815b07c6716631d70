David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has cautioned the church and society at large against mounting unnecessary pressure on public office holders, particularly in terms of financial commitments. He said the fight against corruption would be easier to win if the church and society lessen financial pressures on government officials. Soludo spoke yesterday at the first Session Of 13th Synod of Anglican Diocese of Awka at Saint Peter’s Anglican Church Agulu, Anaocha Council Area of the state themed, “Running the Christian Race: Implications For The Family In Perilous Times” attended by over 30 Archbishop and Bishops. He said part of his administration’s code of conduct included banning public donations by government functionaries. “You can imagine someone whose salary is #300,000, making a pledge of N2 million to the church because he wants to please the crowd, where do you want him to get it from? Of course he must have to steal to pay. “That’s one of the things we’re trying to address by entrenching as part of our code of conduct not making public our donation. You can’t say you were pressured by the priest.” Describing the church as a critical partner and most important civil society group, the Governor commended the church for her support to his government, calling for its sustenance.
