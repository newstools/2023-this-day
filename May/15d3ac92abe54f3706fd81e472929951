The Dangote Refinery has finally become a real thing. Opened for operations in Lagos a few days ago, the refinery has garnered the interest and expectations of many Nigerians, all of whom are hoping that its presence in the country would be for good. Seeing Aliko Dangote and his dear friend, Femi Otedola, standing together and looking like young boys who just created the best gift for Christmas, one can rest knowing that the refinery will bring many positive changes for Nigeria and Nigerians. It has to be said—the friendship between Dangote and Otedola is without equal among their peers. The pair have gone through many ups and downs in times past, much of it arising from the razzmatazz associated with corporate life. Even so, seeing Otedola supporting Dangote brought to mind the beauty of having friends that are understanding and reliable, not backstabbers wishing the worst on others. Otedola has never minced words regarding the importance of Dangote to him. He has referred to Africa’s wealthiest man as his mentor, big brother, and dearest friend many times in the past. Being a man of few words, it is always an eye-opener to see Otedola talking excitedly about Dangote’s business arrangements, the brilliance of it all, and the unquestionable astuteness of the man. On his end, Dangote has also been very vocal about his admiration for the man known as Nigeria’s biggest philanthropist. Many times, he has shown that Otedola’s presence and bearing as a solid and reliable person far outweigh the congregational attitudes of his peers. From how he supports Otedola, it is easy to see that he considers him to be a dear friend, confidante, and altogether precious chum. With the refinery open now, one wonders if the pair will continue to visit together while calculating the benefits that it will bring to the country. With the love they have for each other, their minds may already be similarly considering a bigger project that will be advantageous to Nigerians.
