He noted that his ill mother suffered shock after sighting the video and later passed away as result. He pleaded with relevant authority to intervene in the matter at ensuring that  justice was served accordingly He said one of those who supervised his torture in Ojodu  Lagos was being detained in Ikoyi prison, while a warrant of arrest had been issued for the other two. He alleged that one of the suspects had jumped bail about three times. He said:  “I got wind of moves by some influential persons to kill the case. I plead that relevant authority should intervene and not let me suffer in vain. I have suffered several health challenges after the incident and that I’m still alive today was divine.  I can’t recall the series of test I have run and the amount of money I spent on sick bed. I just started regaining the use of my right ear.”
