When asked how she bounced back shortly after delivery, Jane Mena attributed her new figure 8 body to Getfit Trainers. She expressed that, “As a new Mom, one big fear I always had is the period after Childbirth – “Postpartum”. It’s not because I don’t want to have babies but the body changes and sometimes complications that come with childbirth are always scary. Especially when you have to deal with a saggy belly as a result of one complication or the other. If you are a Mom reading this I know you can relate.” “My fears of postpartum made me not think of having more children until I encountered Getfit. Then I realized that I can go through postpartum without fear. I mean, no more fears of a Saggy belly or belly Fat with the Trainers, the trainers support group reminds me every day that I can have and maintain my figure 8 even during postpartum and afterward and so much more. Right now, I don’t mind having more children because Getfit took away my postpartum fears.” Born Usiwo Orezinena Jane, Jane Mena is a professional dancer and social media influencer.She came in limelight in 2017 after participating in a dancing competition organised by Kcee, the singer.
